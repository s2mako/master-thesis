1001409CHAPTER I                                                                   1
1001549IN my younger and more vulnerable years my father                           1
1001647gave me some advice that I've been turning over                             1
1001723in my mind ever since.                                                      1
1001848"Whenever you feel like criticising any one," he                            1
1001951told me, "just remember that all the people in this                         1
1002051world haven't had the advantages that you've had."                          1
1002145He didn't say any more, but we've always been                               1
1002248unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I                            1
1002347understood that he meant a great deal more than                             1
1002450that.  In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all                          1
1002550judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious                          1
1002644natures to me and also made me the victim of                                1
1002746not a few veteran bores.  The abnormal mind is                              1
1002849quick to detect and attach itself to this quality                           1
1002950when it appears in a normal person, and so it came                          1
1003047about that in college I was unjustly accused of                             1
1003153being a politician, because I was privy to the secret                       1
1003253griefs of wild, unknown men.  Most of the confidences                       1
1003347were unsought--frequently I have feigned sleep,                             1
1003453preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by                       1
1003550some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation                          1
1003646was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate                              1
1003750revelations of young men, or at least the terms in                          1
1003849which they express them, are usually plagiaristic                           2
1003946and marred by obvious suppressions.  Reserving                              2
1004053judgments is a matter of infinite hope.  I am still a                       2
1004155little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as                     2
1004248my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly                            2
1004357repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled                   2
1004424out unequally at birth.                                                     2
1004547And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I                             2
1004651come to the admission that it has a limit.  Conduct                         2
1004751may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes,                         2
1004848but after a certain point I don't care what it's                            2
1004948founded on.  When I came back from the East last                            2
1005046autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in                              2
1005149uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever;                           2
1005251I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged                         2
1005348glimpses into the human heart.  Only Gatsby, the                            2
1005447man who gives his name to this book, was exempt                             2
1005552from my reaction--Gatsby, who represented everything                        2
1005653for which I have an unaffected scorn.  If personality                       2
1005745is an unbroken series of successful gestures,                               2
1005849then there was something gorgeous about him, some                           2
1005953heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if                       2
1006050he were related to one of those intricate machines                          2
1006151that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away.                          2
1006247This responsiveness had nothing to do with that                             2
1006353flabby impressionability which is dignified under the                       2
1006445name of the "creative temperament"--it was an                               2
1006549extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness                           2
1006650such as I have never found in any other person and                          2
1006759which it is not likely I shall ever find again.  No--Gatsby                 3
1006843turned out all right at the end; it is what                                 3
1006947preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the                             3
1007049wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my                           3
1007149interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded                           3
1007217elations of men.                                                            3
1007348My family have been prominent, well-to-do people                            3
1007451in this Middle Western city for three generations.                          3
1007550The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have                          3
1007647a tradition that we're descended from the Dukes                             3
1007751of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was                         3
1007853my grandfather's brother, who came here in fifty-one,                       3
1007947sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started                             3
1008066the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on to-day.           3
1008149I never saw this great-uncle, but I'm supposed to                           3
1008251look like him--with special reference to the rather                         3
1008350hard-boiled painting that hangs in father's office                          3
1008450I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter                          3
1008550of a century after my father, and a little later I                          3
1008647participated in that delayed Teutonic migration                             3
1008751known as the Great War.  I enjoyed the counter-raid                         3
1008849so thoroughly that I came back restless.  Instead                           3
1008942of being the warm centre of the world, the                                  3
1009046Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of                              3
1009151the universe--so I decided to go East and learn the                         3
1009248bond business.  Everybody I knew was in the bond                            3
1009349business, so I supposed it could support one more                           3
1009451single man.  All my aunts and uncles talked it over                         4
1009550as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and                          4
1009653finally said, "Why--ye-es," with very grave, hesitant                       4
1009747faces.  Father agreed to finance me for a year,                             4
1009850and after various delays I came East, permanently,                          4
1009940I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.                                     4
1010050The practical thing was to find rooms in the city,                          4
1010147but it was a warm season, and I had just left a                             4
1010249country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when                           4
1010350a young man at the office suggested that we take a                          4
1010446house together in a commuting town, it sounded                              4
1010556like a great idea.  He found the house, a weather-beaten                    4
1010641cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but                                   4
1010754at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington,                      4
1010843and I went out to the country alone.  I had                                 4
1010949a dog--at least I had him for a few days until he                           4
1011047ran away--and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman,                             4
1011149who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered                           4
1011243Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric                                 4
1011307stove.                                                                      4
1011447It was lonely for a day or so until one morning                             4
1011547some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped                             4
1011616me on the road.                                                             4
1011747"How do you get to West Egg village?"  he asked                             4
1011812helplessly.                                                                 4
1011947I told him.  And as I walked on I was lonely no                             4
1012059longer.  I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler.                  4
1012143He had casually conferred on me the freedom                                 4
1012221of the neighborhood.                                                        4
1012348And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of                            5
1012451leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in                         5
1012553fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life                       5
1012642was beginning over again with the summer.                                   5
1012748There was so much to read, for one thing, and so                            5
1012851much fine health to be pulled down out of the young                         5
1012947breath-giving air.  I bought a dozen volumes on                             5
1013049banking and credit and investment securities, and                           5
1013147they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new                             5
1013252money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining                        5
1013347secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas                             5
1013446knew.  And I had the high intention of reading                              5
1013551many other books besides.  I was rather literary in                         5
1013649college--one year I wrote a series of very solemn                           5
1013751and obvious editorials for the "Yale News"--and now                         5
1013849I was going to bring back all such things into my                           5
1013946life and become again that most limited of all                              5
1014053specialists, the "well-rounded man."  This isn't just                       5
1014149an epigram--life is much more successfully looked                           5
1014236at from a single window, after all.                                         5
1014344It was a matter of chance that I should have                                5
1014450rented a house in one of the strangest communities                          5
1014549in North America.  It was on that slender riotous                           5
1014653island which extends itself due east of New York--and                       5
1014749where there are, among other natural curiosities,                           5
1014839two unusual formations of land.  Twenty                                     5
1014954miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical                      5
1015043in contour and separated only by a courtesy                                 5
1015147bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of                             5
1015251salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet                         6
1015351barnyard of Long Island Sound. they are not perfect                         6
1015447ovals--like the egg in the Columbus story, they                             6
1015551are both crushed flat at the contact end--but their                         6
1015650physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual                          6
1015757confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. to the wingless                   6
1015850a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity                          6
1015943in every particular except shape and size.                                  6
1016052I lived at West Egg, the--well, the less fashionable                        6
1016145of the two, though this is a most superficial                               6
1016252tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister                        6
1016347contrast between them. my house was at the very                             6
1016452tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and                        6
1016548squeezed between two huge places that rented for                            6
1016650twelve or fifteen thousand a season. the one on my                          6
1016751right was a colossal affair by any standard--it was                         6
1016855a factual imitation of some Hotel de Ville in Normandy,                     6
1016938with a tower on one side, spanking new                                      6
1017052under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming                        6
1017143pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and                                 6
1017250garden. it was Gatsby's mansion.  Or, rather, as I                          6
1017350didn't know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited                          6
1017446by a gentleman of that name.  My own house was                              6
1017550an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had                          6
1017648been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a                            6
1017753partial view of my neighbor's lawn, and the consoling                       6
1017849proximity of millionaires--all for eighty dollars                           6
1017909a month.                                                                    6
1018044Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of                                6
1018151fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and                         7
1018254the history of the summer really begins on the evening                      7
1018342I drove over there to have dinner with the                                  7
1018447Tom Buchanans.  Daisy was my second cousin once                             7
1018554removed, and I'd known Tom in college.  And just after                      7
1018647the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.                              7
1018752Her husband, among various physical accomplishments,                        7
1018843had been one of the most powerful ends that                                 7
1018952ever played football at New Haven--a national figure                        7
1019044in a way, one of those men who reach such an                                7
1019154acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything                      7
1019244afterward savors of anti-climax.  His family                                7
1019352were enormously wealthy--even in college his freedom                        7
1019441with money was a matter for reproach--but                                   7
1019548now he'd left Chicago and come East in a fashion                            7
1019648that rather took your breath away: for instance,                            7
1019751he'd brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake                         7
1019847Forest. it was hard to realize that a man in my                             7
1019946own generation was wealthy enough to do that.                               7
1020042Why they came East I don't know.  They had                                  7
1020152spent a year in France for no particular reason, and                        7
1020248then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever                            7
1020348people played polo and were rich together.  This                            7
1020452was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone,                        7
1020544but I didn't believe it--i had no sight into                                7
1020649Daisy's heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on                           7
1020753forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic                       7
1020848turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.                             7
1020947And so it happened that on a warm windy evening                             7
1021047I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends                             8
1021150whom I scarcely knew at all.  Their house was even                          8
1021256more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white                    8
1021342Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the                                  8
1021450bay.  The lawn started at the beach and ran toward                          8
1021552the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over                        8
1021654sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens--finally                      8
1021741when it reached the house drifting up the                                   8
1021848side in bright vines as though from the momentum                            8
1021953of its run.  The front was broken by a line of French                       8
1022049windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide                           8
1022150open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan                          8
1022244in riding clothes was standing with his legs                                8
1022326apart on the front porch.                                                   8
1022442He had changed since his New Haven years.                                   8
1022546Now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty                              8
1022652with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner.                         8
1022741Two shining arrogant eyes had established                                   8
1022851dominance over his face and gave him the appearance                         8
1022944of always leaning aggressively forward.  Not                                8
1023053even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could                       8
1023147hide the enormous power of that body--he seemed                             8
1023252to fill those glistening boots until he strained the                        8
1023352top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle                        8
1023447shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin                             8
1023552coat.  It was a body capable of enormous leverage--a                        8
1023612cruel body.                                                                 8
1023749His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to                           8
1023851the impression of fractiousness he conveyed.  There                         8
1023951was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward                         9
1024048people he liked--and there were men at New Haven                            9
1024124who had hated his guts.                                                     9
1024245"Now, don't think my opinion on these matters                               9
1024346is final," he seemed to say, "just because I'm                              9
1024445stronger and more of a man than you are."  We                               9
1024550were in the same senior society, and while we were                          9
1024650never intimate I always had the impression that he                          9
1024745approved of me and wanted me to like him with                               9
1024844some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.                                 9
1024948We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.                             9
1025047"I've got a nice place here," he said, his eyes                             9
1025127flashing about restlessly.                                                  9
1025240Turning me around by one arm, he moved a                                    9
1025351broad flat hand along the front vista, including in                         9
1025449its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of                           9
1025548deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motor-boat                            9
1025631that bumped the tide offshore.                                              9
1025749"It belonged to Demaine, the oil man."  He turned                           9
1025850me around again, politely and abruptly.  "We'll go                          9
1025909inside."                                                                    9
1026046We walked through a high hallway into a bright                              9
1026153rosy-colored space, fragilely bound into the house by                       9
1026247French windows at either end.  The windows were                             9
1026347ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass                             9
1026449outside that seemed to grow a little way into the                           9
1026553house.  A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains                       9
1026648in at one end and out the other like pale flags,                            9
1026748twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake                            9
1026854of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-colored                     10
1026939rug, making a shadow on it as wind does                                    10
1027012on the sea.                                                                10
1027144The only completely stationary object in the                               10
1027245room was an enormous couch on which two young                              10
1027347women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored                            10
1027452balloon.  They were both in white, and their dresses                       10
1027553were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been                      10
1027653blown back in after a short flight around the house.                       10
1027748I must have stood for a few moments listening to                           10
1027850the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of                         10
1027948a picture on the wall.  Then there was a boom as                           10
1028042Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the                                 10
1028153caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains                      10
1028246and the rugs and the two young women ballooned                             10
1028321slowly to the floor.                                                       10
1028445The younger of the two was a stranger to me.                               10
1028546She was extended full length at her end of the                             10
1028647divan, completely motionless, and with her chin                            10
1028754raised a little, as if she were balancing something on                     10
1028853it which was quite likely to fall.  If she saw me out                      10
1028957of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it--indeed,                  10
1029040I was almost surprised into murmuring an                                   10
1029147apology for having disturbed her by coming in.                             10
1029251The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise--she                        10
1029361leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression--then              10
1029432she laughed, an absurd, charming                                           10
1029548little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward                           10
1029615into the room.                                                             10
1029734"I'm p-paralyzed with happiness."                                          11
1029848She laughed again, as if she said something very                           11
1029948witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up                           11
1030048into my face, promising that there was no one in                           11
1030148the world she so much wanted to see.  That was a                           11
1030253way she had.  She hinted in a murmur that the surname                      11
1030345of the balancing girl was Baker.  (I've heard                              11
1030451it said that Daisy's murmur was only to make people                        11
1030550lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made                         11
1030621it no less charming.)                                                      11
1030752At any rate, Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded                       11
1030844at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly                               11
1030956tipped her head back again--the object she was balancing                   11
1031045had obviously tottered a little and given her                              11
1031147something of a fright.  Again a sort of apology                            11
1031252arose to my lips.  Almost any exhibition of complete                       11
1031350self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.                          11
1031447I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me                            11
1031550questions in her low, thrilling voice.  It was the                         11
1031650kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as                         11
1031751if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will                        11
1031851never be played again.  Her face was sad and lovely                        11
1031950with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright                         11
1032048passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in                           11
1032146her voice that men who had cared for her found                             11
1032254difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered                     11
1032351"Listen," a promise that she had done gay, exciting                        11
1032445things just a while since and that there were                              11
1032548gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.                            11
1032649I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a                          12
1032746day on my way East, and how a dozen people had                             12
1032828sent their love through me.                                                12
1032944"Do they miss me?"  she cried ecstatically.                                12
1033047"The whole town is desolate.  All the cars have                            12
1033147the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning                            12
1033253wreath, and there's a persistent wail all night along                      12
1033318the north shore."                                                          12
1033449"How gorgeous]  Let's go back, Tom.  To-morrow]"                           12
1033542Then she added irrelevantly: "You ought to                                 12
1033615see the baby."                                                             12
1033715"I'd like to."                                                             12
1033847"She's asleep.  She's three years old.  Haven't                            12
1033920you ever seen her?"                                                        12
1034009"Never."                                                                   12
1034140"Well, you ought to see her.  She's----"                                   12
1034246Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly                             12
1034349about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my                          12
1034410shoulder.                                                                  12
1034524"What you doing, Nick?"                                                    12
1034618"I'm a bond man."                                                          12
1034712"Who with?"                                                                12
1034812I told him.                                                                12
1034947"Never heard of them," he remarked decisively.                             12
1035017This annoyed me.                                                           12
1035149"You will," I answered shortly.  "You will if you                          12
1035219stay in the East."                                                         12
1035348"Oh, I'll stay in the East, don't you worry," he                           12
1035450said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if                         12
1035548he were alert for something more.  "I'd be a God                           13
1035636damned fool to live anywhere else."                                        13
1035750At this point Miss Baker said:  "Absolutely]" with                         13
1035848such suddenness that I started--it was the first                           13
1035945word she uttered since I came into the room.                               13
1036052Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for                       13
1036153she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements                      13
1036224stood up into the room.                                                    13
1036348"I'm stiff," she complained, "I've been lying on                           13
1036442that sofa for as long as I can remember."                                  13
1036546"Don't look at me," Daisy retorted, "I've been                             13
1036646trying to get you to New York all afternoon."                              13
1036751"No, thanks," said Miss Baker to the four cocktails                        13
1036843just in from the pantry, "I'm absolutely in                                13
1036911training."                                                                 13
1037038Her host looked at her incredulously.                                      13
1037148"You are]"  He took down his drink as if it were                           13
1037251a drop in the bottom of a glass.  "How you ever get                        13
1037329anything done is beyond me."                                               13
1037445I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was                              13
1037551she "got done."  I enjoyed looking at her.  She was                        13
1037655a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage,                    13
1037742which she accentuated by throwing her body                                 13
1037846backward at the shoulders like a young cadet.                              13
1037949Her gray sun-strained eyes looked back at me with                          13
1038051polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming,                        13
1038146discontented face.  It occurred to me now that                             13
1038246I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere                             13
1038308before.                                                                    13
1038453"You live in West Egg," she remarked contemptuously.                       14
1038525"I know somebody there."                                                   14
1038627"I don't know a single----"                                                14
1038724"You must know Gatsby."                                                    14
1038843"Gatsby?"  demanded Daisy.  "What Gatsby?"                                 14
1038944Before I could reply that he was my neighbor                               14
1039056dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively                   14
1039134under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled                                         14
1039243me from the room as though he were moving a                                14
1039327checker to another square.                                                 14
1039448Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on                           14
1039547their hips, the two young women preceded us out                            14
1039650onto a rosy-colored porch, open toward the sunset,                         14
1039748where four candles flickered on the table in the                           14
1039817diminished wind.                                                           14
1039946"Why candles?"  objected Daisy, frowning.  She                             14
1040049snapped them out with her fingers.  "In two weeks                          14
1040153it'll be the longest day in the year."  She looked at                      14
1040247us all radiantly.  "Do you always watch for the                            14
1040351longest day of the year and then miss it?  I always                        14
1040446watch for the longest day in the year and then                             14
1040510miss it."                                                                  14
1040641"We ought to plan something," yawned Miss                                  14
1040755Baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting                    14
1040810into bed.                                                                  14
1040949"All right," said Daisy.  "What'll we plan?"  She                          14
1041049turned to me helplessly:  "What do people plan?"                           14
1041147Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an                            14
1041238awed expression on her little finger.                                      14
1041339"Look]"  she complained;  "I hurt it."                                     15
1041447We all looked--the knuckle was black and blue.                             15
1041548"You did it, Tom," she said accusingly.  "I know                           15
1041651you didn't mean to, but you did do it.  That's what                        15
1041750I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big,                         15
1041835hulking physical specimen of a----"                                        15
1041950"I hate that word hulking,"  objected Tom crossly,                         15
1042019"even in kidding."                                                         15
1042128"Hulking,"  insisted Daisy.                                                15
1042244Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once,                               15
1042348unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence                           15
1042449that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as                          15
1042552their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the                       15
1042657absence of all desire.  They were here, and they accepted                  15
1042741Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant                                  15
1042852effort to entertain or to be entertained.  They knew                       15
1042948that presently dinner would be over and a little                           15
1043048later the evening too would be over and casually                           15
1043150put away.  It was sharply different from the West,                         15
1043248where an evening was hurried from phase to phase                           15
1043360toward its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation               15
1043437or else in sheer nervous dread of the                                      15
1043515moment itself.                                                             15
1043650"You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy," I confessed                         15
1043749on my second glass of corky but rather impressive                          15
1043839claret.  "Can't you talk about crops or                                    15
1043912something?"                                                                15
1044049I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but                          15
1044138it was taken up in an unexpected way.                                      15
1044248"Civilization's going to pieces,"  broke out Tom                           16
1044351violently.  "I've gotten to be a terrible pessimist                        16
1044453about things.  Have you read 'The Rise of the Colored                      16
1044531Empires' by this man Goddard?"                                             16
1044646"Why, no," I answered, rather surprised by his                             16
1044706tone.                                                                      16
1044847"Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to                            16
1044952read it.  The idea is if we don't look out the white                       16
1045061race will be--will be utterly submerged.  It's all scientific              16
1045127stufff; it's been proved."                                                 16
1045247"Tom's getting very profound," said Daisy, with                            16
1045349an expression of unthoughtful sadness.  "He reads                          16
1045445deep books with long words in them.  What was                              16
1045517that word we----"                                                          16
1045648"Well, these books are all scientific," insisted                           16
1045751Tom, glancing at her impatiently.  "This fellow has                        16
1045851worked out the whole thing.  It's up to us, who are                        16
1045946the dominant race, to watch out or these other                             16
1046036races will have control of things."                                        16
1046147"We've got to beat them down," whispered Daisy,                            16
1046244winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.                                16
1046346"You ought to live in California--" began Miss                             16
1046450Baker, but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily                         16
1046514in his chair.                                                              16
1046648"This idea is that we're Nordics.  I am, and you                           16
1046759are, and you are, and--"  After an infinitesimal hesitation                16
1046844he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she                               16
1046950winked at me again.  "--And we've produced all the                         16
1047052things that go to make civilization--oh, science and                       16
1047133art, and all that.  Do you see?"                                           16
1047250There was something pathetic in his concentration,                         17
1047346as if his complacency, more acute than of old,                             17
1047445was not enough to him any more.  When, almost                              17
1047553immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler                      17
1047646left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary                             17
1047735interruption and leaned toward me.                                         17
1047865"I'll tell you a family secret," she whispered enthusiastically.           17
1047938"It's about the butler's nose.  Do you                                     17
1048039want to hear about the butler's nose?"                                     17
1048135"That's why I came over to-night."                                         17
1048247"Well, he wasn't always a butler; he used to be                            17
1048347the silver polisher for some people in New York                            17
1048450that had a silver service for two hundred people.                          17
1048550He had to polish it from morning till night, until                         17
1048640finally it began to affect his nose----"                                   17
1048747"Things went from bad to worse," suggested Miss                            17
1048807Baker.                                                                     17
1048943"Yes.  Things went from bad to worse, until                                17
1049041finally he had to give up his position."                                   17
1049149For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic                          17
1049252affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled                       17
1049352me forward breathlessly as I listened--then the glow                       17
1049454faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret,                     17
1049549like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.                           17
1049643The butler came back and murmured something                                17
1049749close to Tom's ear, whereupon Tom frowned, pushed                          17
1049848back his chair, and without a word went inside.                            17
1049949As if his absence quickened something within her,                          17
1050049Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and                          17
1050109singing.                                                                   17
1050249"I love to see you at my table, Nick.  You remind                          18
1050352me of a--of a rose, an absolute rose.  Doesn't he?"                        18
1050447She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation:  "An                            18
1050516absolute rose?"                                                            18
1050646This was untrue.  I am not even faintly like a                             18
1050749rose.  She was only extemporizing, but a stirring                          18
1050850warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying                         18
1050956to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless,                   18
1051045thrilling words.  Then suddenly she threw her                              18
1051148napkin on the table and excused herself and went                           18
1051216into the house.                                                            18
1051353Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously                      18
1051440devoid of meaning.  I was about to speak                                   18
1051552when she sat up alertly and said "Sh]"  in a warning                       18
1051640voice.  A subdued impassioned murmur was                                   18
1051749audible in the room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned                          18
1051846forward unashamed, trying to hear.  The murmur                             18
1051946trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down,                             18
1052047mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.                             18
1052149"This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor----"                          18
1052208I said.                                                                    18
1052344"Don't talk.  I want to hear what happens."                                18
1052450"Is something happening?"  I inquired innocently.                          18
1052544"You mean to say you don't know?"  said Miss                               18
1052648Baker, honestly surprised.  "I thought everybody                           18
1052707knew."                                                                     18
1052811"I don't."                                                                 18
1052947"Why----" she said hesitantly,  "Tom's got some                            18
1053020woman in New York."                                                        18
1053139"Got some woman?"  I repeated blankly.                                     19
1053219Miss Baker nodded.                                                         19
1053344"She might have the decency not to telephone                               19
1053439him at dinner time.  Don't you think?"                                     19
1053545Almost before I had grasped her meaning there                              19
1053652was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather                       19
1053741boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at the                                  19
1053807table.                                                                     19
1053948"It couldn't be helped]"  cried Daisy with tense                           19
1054008gayety.                                                                    19
1054147She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker                            19
1054250and then at me, and continued:  "I looked outdoors                         19
1054347for a minute, and it's very romantic outdoors.                             19
1054449There's a bird on the lawn that I think must be a                          19
1054549nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star                          19
1054653Line.  He's singing away----"  Her voice sang:  "It's                      19
1054726romantic, isn't it, Tom?"                                                  19
1054848"Very romantic,"  he said, and then miserably to                           19
1054950me:  "If it's light enough after dinner, I want to                         19
1055031take you down to the stables."                                             19
1055145The telephone rang inside, startingly, and as                              19
1055250Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject                         19
1055357of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air.                   19
1055451Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes                        19
1055548at table I remember the candles being lit again,                           19
1055651pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look                        19
1055752squarely at every one, and yet to avoid all eyes.  I                       19
1055848couldn't guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking,                           19
1055950but I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have                         19
1056053mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly                      20
1056149to put this fifth guest's shrill metallic urgency                          20
1056242out of mind.  To a certain temperament the                                 20
1056346situation might have seemed intriguing--my own                             20
1056445instinct was to telephone immediately for the                              20
1056508police.                                                                    20
1056647The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned                            20
1056748again.  Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of                           20
1056854twilight between them, strolled back into the library,                     20
1056957as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while,                  20
1057055trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf,                    20
1057154I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas                     20
1057244to the porch in front.  In its deep gloom we                               20
1057342sat down side by side on a wicker settee.                                  20
1057450Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its                         20
1057546lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out                             20
1057652into the velvet dusk.  I saw that turbulent emotions                       20
1057749possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be                          20
1057847some sedative questions about her little girl.                             20
1057948"We don't know each other very well, Nick,"  she                           20
1058052said suddenly.  "Even if we are cousins.  You didn't                       20
1058121come to my wedding."                                                       20
1058230"I wasn't back from the war."                                              20
1058349"That's true."  She hesitated.  "Well, I've had a                          20
1058449very bad time, Nick, and I'm pretty cynical about                          20
1058513everything."                                                               20
1058649Evidently she had reason to be.  I waited but she                          20
1058750didn't say any more, and after a moment I returned                         20
1058846rather feebly to the subject of her daughter.                              20
1058950"I suppose she talks, and--eats, and everything."                          21
1059048"Oh, yes."  She looked at me absently.  "Listen,                           21
1059146Nick; let me tell you what I said when she was                             21
1059232born.  Would you like to hear?"                                            21
1059313"Very much."                                                               21
1059455"It'll show you how I've gotten to feel about--things.                     21
1059543Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom                                21
1059648was God knows where.  I woke up out of the ether                           21
1059748with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the                           21
1059853nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl.  She told                      21
1059950me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and                         21
1060055wept.  'all right,' I said, 'i'm glad it's a girl.  And                    21
1060153I hope she'll be a fool--that's the best thing a girl                      21
1060248can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.'                            21
1060347"You see I think everything's terrible anyhow,"                            21
1060450she went on in a convinced way.  "Everybody thinks                         21
1060548so--the most advanced people.  And I know.  I've                           21
1060644been everywhere and seen everything and done                               21
1060754everything."  Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant                     21
1060844way, rather like Tom's, and she laughed with                               21
1060959thrilling scorn.  "Sophisticated--God, I'm sophisticated]"                 21
1061050The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel                         21
1061153my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity                      21
1061251of what she had said.  It made me uneasy, as though                        21
1061350the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to                         21
1061448exact a contributory emotion from me.  I waited,                           21
1061550and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with                         21
1061651an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had                        22
1061749asserted her membership in a rather distinguished                          22
1061846secret society to which she and Tom belonged.                              22
1061945Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light.                               22
1062048Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long                           22
1062150couch and she read aloud to him from the "Saturday                         22
1062252Evening Post"--the words, murmurous and uninflected,                       22
1062341running together in a soothing tune.  The                                  22
1062447lamp-light, bright on his boots and dull on the                            22
1062549autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the                          22
1062652paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender                       22
1062721muscles in her arms.                                                       22
1062847When we came in she held us silent for a moment                            22
1062920with a lifted hand.                                                        22
1063050"To be continued,"  she said, tossing the magazine                         22
1063141on the table,  "in our very next issue."                                   22
1063249Her body asserted itself with a restless movement                          22
1063331of her knee, and she stood up.                                             22
1063448"Ten o'clock,"  she remarked, apparently finding                           22
1063553the time on the ceiling.  "Time for this good girl to                      22
1063612go to bed."                                                                22
1063753"Jordan's going to play in the tournament to-morrow,"                      22
1063840explained Daisy, "over at Westchester."                                    22
1063928"Oh--you're *jordan Baker."                                                22
1064050I knew now why her face was familiar--its pleasing                         22
1064144contemptuous expression had looked out at me                               22
1064251from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life                        22
1064347at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach.  I                            22
1064455had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant                    23
1064543story, but what it was I had forgotten long                                23
1064605ago.                                                                       23
1064744"Good night,"  she said softly.  "Wake me at                               23
1064819eight, won't you."                                                         23
1064920"If you'll get up."                                                        23
1065044"I will.  Good night, Mr. Carraway.  See you                               23
1065107anon."                                                                     23
1065249"Of course you will,"  confirmed Daisy.  "In fact                          23
1065350I think I'll arrange a marriage.  Come over often,                         23
1065452Nick, and I'll sort of--oh--fling you together.  You                       23
1065551know--lock you up accidentally in linen closets and                        23
1065651push you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of                        23
1065710thing----"                                                                 23
1065850"Good night,"  called Miss Baker from the stairs.                          23
1065926"I haven't heard a word."                                                  23
1066047"She's a nice girl,"  said Tom after a moment.                             23
1066148"They oughtn't to let her run around the country                           23
1066211this way."                                                                 23
1066343"Who oughtn't to?"  inquired Daisy coldly.                                 23
1066414"Her family."                                                              23
1066546"Her family is one aunt about a thousand years                             23
1066653old.  Besides, Nick's going to look after her, aren't                      23
1066750you, Nick?  She's going to spend lots of week-ends                         23
1066849out here this summer.  I think the home influence                          23
1066928will be very good for her."                                                23
1067047Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment                            23
1067112in silence.                                                                23
1067242"Is she from New York?"  I asked quickly.                                  23
1067348"From Louisville.  Our white girlhood was passed                           24
1067441together there.  Our beautiful white----"                                  24
1067547"Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk                            24
1067641on the veranda?"  demanded Tom suddenly.                                   24
1067745"Did I?"  She looked at me.  "I can't seem to                              24
1067848remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic                           24
1067952race.  Yes, I'm sure we did.  It sort of crept up on                       24
1068032us and first thing you know----"                                           24
1068146"Don't believe everything you hear, Nick,"  he                             24
1068212advised me.                                                                24
1068351I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and                        24
1068451a few minutes later I got up to go home.  They came                        24
1068547to the door with me and stood side by side in a                            24
1068648cheerful square of light.  As I started my motor                           24
1068735Daisy peremptorily called:  "Wait]                                         24
1068852"I forgot to ask you something, and it's important.                        24
1068939We heard you were engaged to a girl out                                    24
1069007West."                                                                     24
1069146"That's right,"  corroborated Tom kindly.  "We                             24
1069230heard that you were engaged."                                              24
1069329"It's libel.  I'm too poor."                                               24
1069449"But we heard it,"  insisted Daisy, surprising me                          24
1069546by opening up again in a flower-like way.  "We                             24
1069649heard it from three people, so it must be true."                           24
1069745Of course I knew what they were referring to,                              24
1069849but I wasn't even vaguely engaged.  The fact that                          24
1069953gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons                      24
1070043I had come East.  You can't stop going with                                24
1070146an old friend on account of rumors, and on the                             24
1070246other hand I had no intention of being rumored                             25
1070315into marriage.                                                             25
1070446Their interest rather touched me and made them                             25
1070552less remotely rich--nevertheless, I was confused and                       25
1070652a little disgusted as I drove away.  It seemed to me                       25
1070753that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the                      25
1070850house, child in arms--but apparently there were no                         25
1070950such intentions in her head.  As for Tom, the fact                         25
1071047that he "had some woman in New York" was really                            25
1071150less surprising than that he had been depressed by                         25
1071247a book.  Something was making him nibble at the                            25
1071353edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism                      25
1071442no longer nourished his peremptory heart.                                  25
1071545Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs                              25
1071656and in front of wayside garages, where new red gas-pumps                   25
1071745sat out in pools of light, and when I reached                              25
1071850my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed                         25
1071951and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in                        25
1072050the yard.  The wind had blown off, leaving a loud,                         25
1072151bright night, with wings beating in the trees and a                        25
1072249persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the                          25
1072355earth blew the frogs full of life.  The silhouette of a                    25
1072452moving cat wavered across the moonlight, and turning                       25
1072554my head to watch it, I saw that I was not alone--fifty                     25
1072639feet away a figure had emerged from the                                    25
1072748shadow of my neighbor's mansion and was standing                           25
1072850with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver                         25
1072948pepper of the stars.  Something in his leisurely                           25
1073050movements and the secure position of his feet upon                         25
1073150the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself,                         26
1073247come out to determine what share was his of our                            26
1073315local heavens.                                                             26
1073451I decided to call to him.  Miss Baker had mentioned                        26
1073554him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction.                      26
1073639But I didn't call to him, for he gave a                                    26
1073753sudden intimation that he was content to be alone--he                      26
1073844stretched out his arms toward the dark water                               26
1073947in a curious way, and, far as I was from him, I                            26
1074051could have sworn he was trembling.  Involuntarily I                        26
1074149glanced seaward--and distinguished nothing except                          26
1074253a single green light, minute and far away, that might                      26
1074348have been the end of a dock.  When I looked once                           26
1074448more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone                           26
1074531again in the unquiet darkness.                                             26
1074610CHAPTER II                                                                 27
1074744ABOUT half way between West Egg and New York                               27
1074850the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs                         27
1074955beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away                    27
1075055from a certain desolate area of land.  This is a valley                    27
1075148of ashes--a fantastic farm where ashes grow like                           27
1075250wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens;                         27
1075349where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys                          27
1075450and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent                         27
1075541effort, of men who move dimly and already                                  27
1075650crumbling through the powdery air.  Occasionally a                         27
1075756line of gray cars crawls along an invisible track, gives                   27
1075855out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately                    27
1075937the ash-gray men swarm up with leaden                                      27
1076047spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which                            27
1076150screens their obscure operations from your sight.                          27
1076247But above the gray land and the spasms of bleak                            27
1076349dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive,                          27
1076452after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg.                        27
1076547The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and                            27
1076647gigantic--their irises are one yard high.  They                            27
1076749look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of                          27
1076856enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent                   27
1076936nose.  Evidently some wild wag of an                                       27
1077052oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the                       27
1077145borough of Queens, and then sank down himself                              28
1077248into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved                           28
1077354away.  But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless                     28
1077443days, under sun and rain, brood on over the                                28
1077523solemn dumping ground.                                                     28
1077647The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a                            28
1077748small foul river, and, when the drawbridge is up                           28
1077848to let barges through, the passengers on waiting                           28
1077951trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as                        28
1078049half an hour.  There is always a halt there of at                          28
1078149least a minute, and it was because of this that I                          28
1078235first met Tom Buchanan's mistress.                                         28
1078342The fact that he had one was insisted upon                                 28
1078450wherever he was known.  His acquaintances resented                         28
1078549the fact that he turned up in popular restaurants                          28
1078647with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered                            28
1078748about, chatting with whomsoever he knew.  Though                           28
1078858I was curious to see her, I had no desire to meet her--but                 28
1078941I did.  I went up to New York with Tom on                                  28
1079047the train one afternoon, and when we stopped by                            28
1079151the ashheaps he jumped to his feet and, taking hold                        28
1079247of my elbow, literally forced me from the car.                             28
1079350"We're getting off,"  he insisted.  "I want you to                         28
1079415meet my girl."                                                             28
1079551I think he'd tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and                        28
1079645his determination to have my company bordered                              28
1079750on violence.  The supercilious assumption was that                         28
1079848on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.                            28
1079946I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad                             28
1080051fence, and we walked back a hundred yards along the                        29
1080152road under Doctor Eckleburg's persistent stare.  The                       29
1080250only building in sight was a small block of yellow                         29
1080354brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of                     29
1080453compact Main Street ministering to it, and contiguous                      29
1080549to absolutely nothing.  One of the three shops it                          29
1080651contained was for rent and another was an all-night                        29
1080753restaurant, approached by a trail of ashes; the third                      29
1080846was a garage--repairs. GEORGE B. WILSON.  Cars                             29
1080945bought and sold.--and I followed Tom inside.                               29
1081048The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only                           29
1081148car visible was the dust-covered wreck of a Ford                           29
1081251which crouched in a dim corner.  It had occurred to                        29
1081352me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and                       29
1081453that sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed                      29
1081546overhead, when the proprietor himself appeared                             29
1081642in the door of an office, wiping his hands                                 29
1081753on a piece of waste.  He was a blond, spiritless man,                      29
1081846anaemic, and faintly handsome.  When he saw us                             29
1081947a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue                            29
1082006eyes.                                                                      29
1082145"Hello, Wilson, old man,"  said Tom, slapping                              29
1082249him jovially on the shoulder.  "How's business?"                           29
1082353"I can't complain,"  answered Wilson unconvincingly.                       29
1082442"When are you going to sell me that car?"                                  29
1082541"Next week; I've got my man working on it                                  29
1082606now."                                                                      29
1082731"Works pretty slow, don't he?"                                             29
1082848"No, he doesn't,"  said Tom coldly.  "And if you                           29
1082958feel that way about it, maybe I'd better sell it somewhere                 30
1083017else after all."                                                           30
1083147"I don't mean that," explained Wilson quickly.                             30
1083218"I just meant----"                                                         30
1083347His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently                            30
1083447around the garage.  Then I heard footsteps on a                            30
1083548stairs, and in a moment the thickish figure of a                           30
1083650woman blocked out the light from the office door.                          30
1083754She was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but                     30
1083860she carried her surplus flesh sensuously as some women can.                30
1083960Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crepe-de-chine,               30
1084038contained no facet or gleam of beauty,                                     30
1084149but there was an immediately perceptible vitality                          30
1084255about her as if the nerves of her body were continually                    30
1084344smouldering.  She smiled slowly and, walking                               30
1084448through her husband as if he were a ghost, shook                           30
1084546hands with Tom, looking him flush in the eye.                              30
1084649Then she wet her lips, and without turning around                          30
1084745spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:                              30
1084844"Get some chairs, why don't you, so somebody                               30
1084915can sit down."                                                             30
1085046"Oh, sure,"  agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went                             30
1085151toward the little office, mingling immediately with                        30
1085250the cement color of the walls.  A white ashen dust                         30
1085351veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled                        30
1085448everything in the vicinity--except his wife, who                           30
1085520moved close to Tom.                                                        30
1085648"I want to see you," said Tom intently.  "Get on                           30
1085717the next train."                                                           30
1085813"All right."                                                               31
1085945"I'll meet you by the news-stand on the lower                              31
1086008level."                                                                    31
1086142She nodded and moved away from him just as                                 31
1086246George Wilson emerged with two chairs from his                             31
1086313office door.                                                               31
1086450We waited for her down the road and out of sight.                          31
1086550It was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a                         31
1086652gray, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in                       31
1086732a row along the railroad track.                                            31
1086849"Terrible place, isn't it,"  said Tom, exchanging                          31
1086931a frown with Doctor Eckleburg.                                             31
1087009"Awful."                                                                   31
1087132"It does her good to get away."                                            31
1087230"Doesn't her husband object?"                                              31
1087349"Wilson?  He thinks she goes to see her sister in                          31
1087444New York.  He's so dumb he doesn't know he's                               31
1087508alive."                                                                    31
1087651So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together                        31
1087745to New York--or not quite together, for Mrs.                               31
1087850Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom deferred                         31
1087951that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers                        31
1088027who might be on the train.                                                 31
1088144She had changed her dress to a brown figured                               31
1088250muslin, which stretched tight over her rather wide                         31
1088345hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New                              31
1088451York.  At the news-stand she bought a copy of "Town                        31
1088549Tattle" and a moving-picture magazine, and in the                          31
1088646station drug-store some cold cream and a small                             31
1088751flask of perfume.  Up-stairs, in the solemn echoing                        32
1088849drive she let four taxicabs drive away before she                          32
1088958selected a new one, lavender-colored with gray upholstery,                 32
1089040and in this we slid out from the mass of                                   32
1089155the station into the glowing sunshine.  But immediately                    32
1089239she turned sharply from the window and,                                    32
1089344leaning forward, tapped on the front glass.                                32
1089456"I want to get one of those dogs,"  she said earnestly.                    32
1089546"I want to get one for the apartment.  They're                             32
1089622nice to have--a dog."                                                      32
1089742We backed up to a gray old man who bore an                                 32
1089848absurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller.  In a                           32
1089947basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very                            32
1090042recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.                                  32
1090140"What kind are they?"  asked Mrs. Wilson                                   32
1090240eagerly, as he came to the taxi-window.                                    32
1090343"All kinds.  What kind do you want, lady?"                                 32
1090450"I'd like to get one of those police dogs; I don't                         32
1090528suppose you got that kind?"                                                32
1090642The man peered doubtfully into the basket,                                 32
1090747plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling,                            32
1090825by the back of the neck.                                                   32
1090935"That's no police dog,"  said Tom.                                         32
1091050"No, it's not exactly a police dog,"  said the man                         32
1091151with disappointment in his voice.  "It's more of an                        32
1091254Airedale."  He passed his hand over the brown wash-rag                     32
1091344of a back.  "Look at that coat.  Some coat.                                32
1091451That's a dog that'll never bother you with catching                        32
1091507cold."                                                                     32
1091657"I think it's cute,"  said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically.                   33
1091718"How much is it?"                                                          33
1091847"That dog?"  He looked at it admiringly.  "That                            33
1091932dog will cost you ten dollars."                                            33
1092047The Airedale--undoubtedly there was an Airedale                            33
1092147concerned in it somewhere, though its feet were                            33
1092249startlingly white--changed hands and settled down                          33
1092359into Mrs. Wilson's lap, where she fondled the weather-proof                33
1092419coat with rapture.                                                         33
1092548"Is it a boy or a girl?"  she asked delicately.                            33
1092631"That dog?  That dog's a boy."                                             33
1092751"It's a bitch,"  said Tom decisively.  "Here's your                        33
1092843money.  Go and buy ten more dogs with it."                                 33
1092948We drove over to Fifth Avenue, so warm and soft,                           33
1093047almost pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon                            33
1093156that I wouldn't have been surprised to see a great flock                   33
1093232of white sheep turn the corner.                                            33
1093340"Hold on,"  I said, "I have to leave you                                   33
1093407here."                                                                     33
1093541"No, you don't," interposed Tom quickly.                                   33
1093646"Myrtle'll be hurt if you don't come up to the                             33
1093732apartment.  Won't you, Myrtle?"                                            33
1093848"Come on," she urged.  "I'll telephone my sister                           33
1093953Catherine.  She's said to be very beautiful by people                      33
1094020who ought to know."                                                        33
1094128"Well, I'd like to, but----"                                               33
1094244We went on, cutting back again over the Park                               33
1094346toward the West Hundreds.  At 158th Street the                             33
1094448cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of                           33
1094546apartment-houses.  Throwing a regal homecoming                             34
1094652glance around the neighborhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered                       34
1094744up her dog and her other purchases, and went                               34
1094814haughtily in.                                                              34
1094944"I'm going to have the MCkees come up,"  she                               34
1095047announced as we rose in the elevator.  "And, of                            34
1095142course, I got to call up my sister, too."                                  34
1095243The apartment was on the top floor--a small                                34
1095350living-room, a small dining-room, a small bedroom,                         34
1095447and a bath.  The living-room was crowded to the                            34
1095553doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too                      34
1095650large for it, so that to move about was to stumble                         34
1095749continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the                          34
1095847gardens of Versailles.  The only picture was an                            34
1095950over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting                         34
1096055on a blurred rock.  Looked at from a distance, however,                    34
1096146the hen resolved itself into a bonnet, and the                             34
1096248countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into                           34
1096353the room.  Several old copies of "Town Tattle" lay on                      34
1096447the table together with a copy of "Simon Called                            34
1096550Peter," and some of the small scandal magazines of                         34
1096647Broadway.  Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with                            34
1096749the dog.  A reluctant elevator-boy went for a box                          34
1096849full of straw and some milk, to which he added on                          34
1096957his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog-biscuits--one                  34
1097047of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer                            34
1097149of milk all afternoon.  Meanwhile Tom brought out                          34
1097247a bottle of whiskey from a locked bureau door.                             34
1097348I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the                           34
1097450second time was that afternoon; so everything that                         35
1097547happened has a dim, hazy cast over it, although                            35
1097651until after eight o'clock the apartment was full of                        35
1097747cheerful sun.  Sitting on Tom's lap Mrs. Wilson                            35
1097853called up several people on the telephone; then there                      35
1097949were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some at                          35
1098046the drugstore on the corner.  When I came back                             35
1098146they had disappeared, so I sat down discreetly                             35
1098247in the living-room and read a chapter of "Simon                            35
1098350Called Peter"--either it was terrible stuff or the                         35
1098448whiskey distorted things, because it didn't make                           35
1098517any sense to me.                                                           35
1098651Just as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs.                         35
1098750Wilson and I called each other by our first names)                         35
1098846reappeared, company commenced to arrive at the                             35
1098916apartment-door.                                                            35
1099050The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl                         35
1099154of about thirty, with a solid, sticky bob of red hair,                     35
1099253and a complexion powdered milky white.  Her eye-brows                      35
1099340had been plucked and then drawn on again                                   35
1099449at a more rakish angle, but the efforts of nature                          35
1099550toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a                         35
1099646blurred air to her face.  When she moved about                             35
1099754there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery                     35
1099845bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms.                               35
1099946She came in with such a proprietary haste, and                             35
1100051looked around so possessively at the furniture that                        35
1100151I wondered if she lived here.  But when I asked her                        35
1100246she laughed immoderately, repeated my question                             35
1100352aloud, and told me she lived with a girl friend at a                       36
1100407hotel.                                                                     36
1100543Mr. MCkee was a pale, feminine man from the                                36
1100648flat below.  He had just shaved, for there was a                           36
1100749white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he was                          36
1100851most respectful in his greeting to every one in the                        36
1100950room.  He informed me that he was in the "artistic                         36
1101054game," and I gathered later that he was a photographer                     36
1101141and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs.                                   36
1101247Wilson's mother which hovered like an ectoplasm                            36
1101353on the wall.  His wife was shrill, languid, handsome,                      36
1101454and horrible.  She told me with pride that her husband                     36
1101547had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven                            36
1101635times since they had been married.                                         36
1101745Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time                              36
1101853before, and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon                      36
1101946dress of cream-colored chiffon, which gave out                             36
1102048a continual rustle as she swept about the room.                            36
1102151With the influence of the dress her personality had                        36
1102251also undergone a change.  The intense vitality that                        36
1102350had been so remarkable in the garage was converted                         36
1102453into impressive hauteur.  Her laughter, her gestures,                      36
1102552her assertions became more violently affected moment                       36
1102639by moment, and as she expanded the room                                    36
1102747grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be                            36
1102848revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the                           36
1102911smoky air.                                                                 36
1103050"My dear,"  she told her sister in a high, mincing                         36
1103150shout,  "most of these fellas will cheat you every                         36
1103249time.  All they think of is money.  I had a woman                          37
1103350up here last week to look at my feet, and when she                         37
1103444gave me the bill you'd of thought she had my                               37
1103519appendicitus out."                                                         37
1103646"What was the name of the woman?"  asked Mrs.                              37
1103707MCkee.                                                                     37
1103844"Mrs. Eberhardt.  She goes around looking at                               37
1103935people's feet in their own homes."                                         37
1104046"I like your dress,"  remarked Mrs. MCkee,  "I                             37
1104122think it's adorable."                                                      37
1104246Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising                             37
1104324her eyebrow in disdain.                                                    37
1104455"It's just a crazy old thing,"  she said.  "I just slip                    37
1104545it on sometimes when I don't care what I look                              37
1104607like."                                                                     37
1104743"But it looks wonderful on you, if you know                                37
1104847what I mean,"  pursued Mrs. MCkee.  "If Chester                            37
1104948could only get you in that pose I think he could                           37
1105023make something of it."                                                     37
1105152We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed                       37
1105239a strand of hair from over her eyes and                                    37
1105352looked back at us with a brilliant smile.  Mr. MCkee                       37
1105448regarded her intently with his head on one side,                           37
1105548and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in                           37
1105619front of his face.                                                         37
1105754"I should change the light,"  he said after a moment.                      37
1105843"I'd like to bring out the modelling of the                                37
1105950features.  And I'd try to get hold of all the back                         37
1106007hair."                                                                     37
1106148"I wouldn't think of changing the light,"  cried                           38
1106231Mrs. MCkee.  "I think it's----"                                            38
1106348Her husband said "*sh]" and we all looked at the                           38
1106444subject again, whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned                               38
1106529audibly and got to his feet.                                               38
1106648"You MCkees have something to drink,"  he said.                            38
1106745"Get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle,                              38
1106833before everybody goes to sleep."                                           38
1106947"I told that boy about the ice."  Myrtle raised                            38
1107051her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the                        38
1107147lower orders.  "These people]  You have to keep                            38
1107226after them all the time."                                                  38
1107347She looked at me and laughed pointlessly.  Then                            38
1107453she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy,                      38
1107549and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen                          38
1107632chefs awaited her orders there.                                            38
1107748"I've done some nice things out on Long Island,"                           38
1107820asserted Mr. MCkee.                                                        38
1107927Tom looked at him blankly.                                                 38
1108042"Two of them we have framed down-stairs."                                  38
1108127"Two what?"  demanded Tom.                                                 38
1108242"Two studies.  One of them I call 'Montauk                                 38
1108348POINT--the Gulls,' and the other I call 'Montauk                           38
1108418POINT--the Sea.'"                                                          38
1108546The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the                             38
1108607couch.                                                                     38
1108755"Do you live down on Long Island, too?"  she inquired.                     38
1108822"I live at West Egg."                                                      38
1108945"Really?  I was down there at a party about a                              39
1109044month ago.  At a man named Gatsby's.  Do you                               39
1109111know him?"                                                                 39
1109227"I live next door to him."                                                 39
1109344"Well, they say he's a nephew or a cousin of                               39
1109451Kaiser Wilhelm's.  That's where all his money comes                        39
1109507from."                                                                     39
1109610"Really?"                                                                  39
1109712She nodded.                                                                39
1109845"I'm scared of him.  I'd hate to have him get                              39
1109917anything on me."                                                           39
1110044This absorbing information about my neighbor                               39
1110149was interrupted by Mrs. MCkee's pointing suddenly                          39
1110213at Catherine:                                                              39
1110345"Chester, I think you could do something with                              39
1110447her,"  she broke out, but Mr. MCkee only nodded                            39
1110543in a bored way, and turned his attention to                                39
1110605Tom.                                                                       39
1110746"I'd like to do more work on Long Island, if I                             39
1110851could get the entry.  All I ask is that they should                        39
1110918give me a start."                                                          39
1111046"Ask Myrtle,"  said Tom, breaking into a short                             39
1111147shout of laughter as Mrs. Wilson entered with a                            39
1111255tray.  "She'll give you a letter of introduction, won't                    39
1111313you Myrtle?"                                                               39
1111432"Do what?" she asked, startled.                                            39
1111546"You'll give MCkee a letter of introduction to                             39
1111649your husband, so he can do some studies of him."                           39
1111753His lips moved silently for a moment as he invented.                       39
1111844"'george B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,' or                               40
1111922something like that."                                                      40
1112045Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in                              40
1112107my ear:                                                                    40
1112245"Neither of them can stand the person they're                              40
1112313married to."                                                               40
1112414"Can't they?"                                                              40
1112545"Can't stand them."  She looked at Myrtle and                              40
1112646then at Tom.  "What I say is, why go on living                             40
1112750with them if they can't stand them?  If I was them                         40
1112847I'd get a divorce and get married to each other                            40
1112913right away."                                                               40
1113034"Doesn't she like Wilson either?"                                          40
1113148The answer to this was unexpected.  It came from                           40
1113250Myrtle, who had overheard the question, and it was                         40
1113321violent and obscene.                                                       40
1113446"You see,"  cried Catherine triumphantly.  She                             40
1113554lowered her voice again.  "It's really his wife that's                     40
1113647keeping them apart.  She's a Catholic, and they                            40
1113727don't believe in divorce."                                                 40
1113844Daisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little                               40
1113941shocked at the elaborateness of the lie.                                   40
1114049"When they do get married,"  continued Catherine,                          40
1114145"they're going West to live for a while until                              40
1114216it blows over."                                                            40
1114341"It'd be more discreet to go to Europe."                                   40
1114455"Oh, do you like Europe?"  she exclaimed surprisingly.                     40
1114536"I just got back from Monte Carlo."                                        40
1114610"Really."                                                                  40
1114748"Just last year.  I went over there with another                           41
1114807girl."                                                                     41
1114913"Stay long?"                                                               41
1115043"No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back.                                 41
1115149We went by way of Marseilles.  We had over twelve                          41
1115250hundred dollars when we started, but we got gypped                         41
1115351out of it all in two days in the private rooms.  We                        41
1115448had an awful time getting back, I can tell you.                            41
1115529God, how I hated that town]"                                               41
1115644The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window                               41
1115759for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean--then                41
1115837the shrill voice of Mrs. MCkee called                                      41
1115923me back into the room.                                                     41
1116045"I almost made a mistake, too,"  she declared                              41
1116150vigorously.  "I almost married a little kyke who'd                         41
1116250been after me for years.  I knew he was below me.                          41
1116350Everybody kept saying to me:  'Lucille, that man's                         41
1116451'way below you]'  But if I hadn't met Chester, he'd                        41
1116517of got me sure."                                                           41
1116651"Yes, but listen,"  said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her                        41
1116751head up and down, "at least you didn't marry him."                         41
1116819"I know I didn't."                                                         41
1116950"Well, I married him,"  said Myrtle, ambiguously.                          41
1117048"And that's the difference between your case and                           41
1117107mine."                                                                     41
1117244"Why did you, Myrtle?"  demanded Catherine.                                41
1117324"Nobody forced you to."                                                    41
1117419Myrtle considered.                                                         41
1117553"I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,"                      41
1117637she said finally.  "I thought he knew                                      42
1117751something about breeding, but he wasn't fit to lick                        42
1117810my shoe."                                                                  42
1117945"You were crazy about him for a while,"  said                              42
1118011Catherine.                                                                 42
1118148"Crazy about him]"  cried Myrtle incredulously.                            42
1118249"Who said I was crazy about him?  I never was any                          42
1118346more crazy about him than I was about that man                             42
1118408there."                                                                    42
1118548She pointed suddenly at me, and every one looked                           42
1118651at me accusingly.  I tried to show by my expression                        42
1118739that I had played no part in her past.                                     42
1118846"The only crazy I was was when I married him.                              42
1118948I knew right away I made a mistake.  He borrowed                           42
1119049somebody's best suit to get married in, and never                          42
1119152even told me about it, and the man came after it one                       42
1119267day when he was out."  She looked around to see who was listening.         42
1119328"'oh, is that your suit?'  I                                               42
1119456said.  'this is the first I ever heard about it.'  But I                   42
1119547gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to                            42
1119630beat the band all afternoon."                                              42
1119749"She really ought to get away from him,"  resumed                          42
1119843Catherine to me.  "They've been living over                                42
1119950that garage for eleven years.  And tom's the first                         42
1120023sweetie she ever had."                                                     42
1120144The bottle of whiskey--a second one--was now                               42
1120255in constant demand by all present, excepting Catherine,                    42
1120343who "felt just as good on nothing at all."                                 42
1120446Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some                             42
1120551celebrated sandwiches, which were a complete supper                        42
1120654in themselves.  I wanted to get out and walk southward                     43
1120746toward the park through the soft twilight, but                             43
1120850each time I tried to go I became entangled in some                         43
1120951wild, strident argument which pulled me back, as if                        43
1121050with ropes, into my chair.  Yet high over the city                         43
1121148our line of yellow windows must have contributed                           43
1121250their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher                         43
1121352in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking                       43
1121444up and wondering.  I was within and without,                               43
1121558simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible                 43
1121617variety of life.                                                           43
1121751Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly                        43
1121840her warm breath poured over me the story                                   43
1121931of her first meeting with Tom.                                             43
1122049"It was on the two little seats facing each other                          43
1122151that are always the last ones left on the train.  I                        43
1122245was going up to New York to see my sister and                              43
1122351spend the night.  He had on a dress suit and patent                        43
1122451leather shoes, and I couldn't keep my eyes off him,                        43
1122547but every time he looked at me I had to pretend                            43
1122650to be looking at the advertisement over his head.                          43
1122748When we came into the station he was next to me,                           43
1122849and his white shirt-front pressed against my arm,                          43
1122951and so I told him I'd have to call a policeman, but                        43
1123049he knew I lied.  I was so excited that when I got                          43
1123150into a taxi with him I didn't hardly know I wasn't                         43
1123249getting into a subway train.  All I kept thinking                          43
1123350about, over and over, was 'You can't live forever;                         43
1123426you can't live forever.'"                                                  43
1123542She turned to Mrs. MCkee and the room rang                                 44
1123633full of her artificial laughter.                                           44
1123746"My dear,"  she cried,  "I'm going to give you                             44
1123852this dress as soon as I'm through with it.  I've got                       44
1123948to get another one to-morrow.  I'm going to make                           44
1124052a list of all the things I've got to get.  A massage                       44
1124148and a wave, and a collar for the dog, and one of                           44
1124253those cute little ash-trays where you touch a spring,                      44
1124347and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother's                            44
1124451grave that'll last all summer.  I got to write down                        44
1124554a list so I won't forget all the things I got to do."                      44
1124649It was nine o'clock--almost immediately afterward                          44
1124743I looked at my watch and found it was ten.                                 44
1124846Mr. MCkee was asleep on a chair with his fists                             44
1124950clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of                         44
1125048action.  Taking out my handkerchief I wiped from                           44
1125166his cheek the remains of the spot of dried lather that had worried         44
1125222me all the afternoon.                                                      44
1125347The little dog was sitting on the table looking                            44
1125448with blind eyes through the smoke, and from time                           44
1125558to time groaning faintly.  People disappeared, reappeared,                 44
1125636made plans to go somewhere, and then                                       44
1125752lost each other, searched for each other, found each                       44
1125849other a few feet away.  Some time toward midnight                          44
1125947Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face                            44
1126048discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs.                            44
1126146Wilson had any right to mention Daisy's name.                              44
1126247"Daisy]  Daisy]  Daisy]"  shouted Mrs. Wilson.                             44
1126350"I'll say it whenever I want to]  Daisy]  Dai----"                         44
1126442Making a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan                                 45
1126535broke her nose with his open hand.                                         45
1126648Then there were bloody towels upon the bath-room                           45
1126744floor, and women's voices scolding, and high                               45
1126847over the confusion a long broken wail of pain.                             45
1126946Mr. MCkee awoke from his doze and started in a                             45
1127048daze toward the door.  When he had gone half way                           45
1127150he turned around and stared at the scene--his wife                         45
1127253and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled                      45
1127342here and there among the crowded furniture                                 45
1127454with articles of aid, and the despairing figure on the                     45
1127553couch, bleeding fluently, and trying to spread a copy                      45
1127657of "Town Tattle" over the tapestry scenes of Versailles.                   45
1127746Then Mr. MCkee turned and continued on out the                             45
1127854door.  Taking my hat from the chandelier, I followed.                      45
1127946"Come to lunch some day,"  he suggested, as we                             45
1128030groaned down in the elevator.                                              45
1128109"Where?"                                                                   45
1128212"Anywhere."                                                                45
1128354"Keep your hands off the lever,"  snapped the elevator                     45
1128405boy.                                                                       45
1128550"I beg your pardon,"  said Mr. MCkee with dignity,                         45
1128635"I didn't know I was touching it."                                         45
1128744"All right,"  I agreed,  "I'll be glad to."                                45
1128854. . . I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting                     45
1128945up between the sheets, clad in his underwear,                              45
1129037with a great portfolio in his hands.                                       45
1129148"Beauty and the Beast . . . Loneliness . . . Old                           45
1129244Grocery Horse . . . Brook'n Bridge . . . ."                                45
1129346then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower                             46
1129449level of the Pennsylvania Station, staring at the                          46
1129549morning Tribune, and waiting for the four o'clock                          46
1129608 train.                                                                    46
1129711CHAPTER III                                                                47
1129848THERE was music from my neighbor's house through                           47
1129947the summer nights.  In his blue gardens men and                            47
1130052girls came and went like moths among the whisperings                       47
1130141and the champagne and the stars.  At high                                  47
1130249tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving                          47
1130352from the tower of his raft, or taking the sun on the                       47
1130452hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats slit                       47
1130548the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over                           47
1130648cataracts of foam.  On week-ends his Rolls-Royce                           47
1130746became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from                             47
1130850the city between nine in the morning and long past                         47
1130950midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a                         47
1131052brisk yellow bug to meet all trains.  And on Mondays                       47
1131144eight servants, including an extra gardener,                               47
1131250toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and                         47
1131348hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages                           47
1131421of the night before.                                                       47
1131546Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons                             47
1131650arrived from a fruiterer in New York--every Monday                         47
1131743these same oranges and lemons left his back                                47
1131850door in a pyramid of pulpless halves.  There was a                         47
1131946machine in the kitchen which could extract the                             47
1132049juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a                          47
1132148little button was pressed two hundred times by a                           47
1132216butler's thumb.                                                            47
1132350At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came                         48
1132444down with several hundred feet of canvas and                               48
1132549enough colored lights to make a Christmas tree of                          48
1132654Gatsby's enormous garden.  On buffet tables, garnished                     48
1132743with glistening hors-d'oeuvre, spiced baked                                48
1132848hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs                           48
1132947and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark                            48
1133052gold.  In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail                       48
1133149was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and                          48
1133248with cordials so long forgotten that most of his                           48
1133345female guests were too young to know one from                              48
1133409another.                                                                   48
1133546By seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived, no                             48
1133655thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and                    48
1133746trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets                             48
1133847and piccolos, and low and high drums.  The last                            48
1133944swimmers have come in from the beach now and                               48
1134050are dressing up-stairs; the cars from New York are                         48
1134146parked five deep in the drive, and already the                             48
1134244halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with                               48
1134345primary colors, and hair shorn in strange new                              48
1134447ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile.                             48
1134548The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of                           48
1134648cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the                           48
1134750air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual                         48
1134849innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot,                          48
1134943and enthusiastic meetings between women who                                48
1135031never knew each other's names.                                             48
1135145The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches                              48
1135251away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing                        49
1135346yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices                             49
1135451pitches a key higher.  Laughter is easier minute by                        49
1135549minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a                          49
1135647cheerful word.  The groups change more swiftly,                            49
1135749swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the                          49
1135851same breath; already there are wanderers, confident                        49
1135948girls who weave here and there among the stouter                           49
1136050and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment                         49
1136145the centre of a group, and then, excited with                              49
1136249triumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces                          49
1136350and voices and color under the constantly changing                         49
1136407light.                                                                     49
1136547Suddenly one of the gypsies, in trembling opal,                            49
1136651seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for                        49
1136749courage and, moving her hands like Frisco, dances                          49
1136846out alone on the canvas platform.  A momentary                             49
1136955hush; the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly                    49
1137047for her, and there is a burst of chatter as the                            49
1137151erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray's                        49
1137253understudy from the "Follies."  The party has begun.                       49
1137352I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby's                       49
1137441house I was one of the few guests who had                                  49
1137553actually been invited.  People were not invited--they                      49
1137644went there.  They got into automobiles which                               49
1137746bore them out to Long Island, and somehow they                             49
1137848ended up at Gatsby's door.  Once there they were                           49
1137943introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and                                49
1138049after that they conducted themselves according to                          49
1138147the rules of behavior associated with amusement                            50
1138251parks.  Sometimes they came and went without having                        50
1138344met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a                               50
1138458simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission.                  50
1138546I had been actually invited.  A chauffeur in a                             50
1138649uniform of robin's-egg blue crossed my lawn early                          50
1138748that Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal                           50
1138852note from his employer:  the honor would be entirely                       50
1138955Gatsby's, it said, if I would attend his "little party"                    50
1139012that night.                                                                50
1139137He had seen me several times, and had                                      50
1139250intended to call on me long before, but a peculiar                         50
1139353combination of circumstances had prevented it--signed                      50
1139432Jay Gatsby, in a majestic hand.                                            50
1139547Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his                            50
1139646lawn a little after seven, and wandered around                             50
1139752rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people                       50
1139847I didn't know--though here and there was a face                            50
1139956I had noticed on the commuting train.  I was immediately                   50
1140040struck by the number of young Englishmen                                   50
1140145dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a                              50
1140253little hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices                      50
1140351to solid and prosperous Americans.  I was sure that                        50
1140450they were selling something: bonds or insurance or                         50
1140550automobiles.  They were at least agonizingly aware                         50
1140647of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced                            50
1140747that it was theirs for a few words in the right                            50
1140805key.                                                                       50
1140946As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find                             50
1141046my host, but the two or three people of whom I                             51
1141145asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an                              51
1141250amazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowledge                         51
1141351of his movements, that I slunk off in the direction                        51
1141444of the cocktail table--the only place in the                               51
1141546garden where a single man could linger without                             51
1141631looking purposeless and alone.                                             51
1141747I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer                            51
1141847embarrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the                            51
1141948house and stood at the head of the marble steps,                           51
1142055leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous                    51
1142131interest down into the garden.                                             51
1142246Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach                             51
1142351myself to some one before I should begin to address                        51
1142435cordial remarks to the passers-by.                                         51
1142545"Hello]"  I roared, advancing toward her.  My                              51
1142649voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden.                           51
1142745"I thought you might be here,"  she responded                              51
1142847absently as I came up.  "I remembered you lived                            51
1142918next door to ----"                                                         51
1143048She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that                           51
1143150she'd take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to                         51
1143248two girls in twin yellow dresses, who stopped at                           51
1143323the foot of the steps.                                                     51
1143449"Hello]"  they cried together.  "Sorry you didn't                          51
1143506win."                                                                      51
1143647That was for the golf tournament.  She had lost                            51
1143731in the finals the week before.                                             51
1143845"You don't know who we are,"  said one of the                              51
1143945girls in yellow, "but we met you here about a                              52
1144012month ago."                                                                52
1144145"You've dyed your hair since then,"  remarked                              52
1144246Jordan, and I started, but the girls had moved                             52
1144357casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature                  52
1144445moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out                              52
1144552of a caterer's basket.  With Jordan's slender golden                       52
1144647arm resting in mine, we descended the steps and                            52
1144748sauntered about the garden.  A tray of cocktails                           52
1144851floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down                        52
1144949at a table with the two girls in yellow and three                          52
1145046men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.                              52
1145147"Do you come to these parties often?"  inquired                            52
1145231Jordan of the girl beside her.                                             52
1145350"The last one was the one I met you at,"  answered                         52
1145443the girl, in an alert confident voice.  She                                52
1145545turned to her companion:  "Wasn't it for you,                              52
1145610Lucille?"                                                                  52
1145725It was for Lucille, too.                                                   52
1145852"I like to come,"  Lucille said.  "I never care what                       52
1145952I do, so I always have a good time.  When I was here                       52
1146047last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me                            52
1146145my name and address--inside of a week I got a                              52
1146247package from Croirier's with a new evening gown                            52
1146308in it."                                                                    52
1146434"Did you keep it?"  asked Jordan.                                          52
1146550"Sure I did.  I was going to wear it to-night, but                         52
1146650it was too big in the bust and had to be altered.                          52
1146749It was gas blue with lavender beads.  Two hundred                          52
1146825and sixty-five dollars."                                                   52
1146947"There's something funny about a fellow that'll                            53
1147053do a thing like that,"  said the other girl eagerly.                       53
1147144"He doesn't want any trouble with anybody."                                53
1147228"Who doesn't?"  I inquired.                                                53
1147331"Gatsby.  Somebody told me----"                                            53
1147457The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.                   53
1147542"Somebody told me they thought he killed a                                 53
1147611man once."                                                                 53
1147747A thrill passed over all of us.  The three Mr.                             53
1147843Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly.                                 53
1147950"I don't think it's so much that,"  argued Lucille                         53
1148048sceptically; "it's more that he was a German spy                           53
1148117during the war."                                                           53
1148239One of the men nodded in confirmation.                                     53
1148343"I heard that from a man who knew all about                                53
1148449him, grew up with him in Germany,"  he assured us                          53
1148512positively.                                                                53
1148654"Oh, no,"  said the first girl,  "it couldn't be that,                     53
1148746because he was in the American army during the                             53
1148848war."  As our credulity switched back to her she                           53
1148949leaned forward with enthusiasm.  "You look at him                          53
1149050sometimes when he thinks nobody's looking at him.                          53
1149127I'll bet he killed a man."                                                 53
1149255She narrowed her eyes and shivered.  Lucille shivered.                     53
1149344We all turned and looked around for Gatsby.                                53
1149456It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired                   53
1149539that there were whispers about him from                                    53
1149644those who found little that it was necessary                               53
1149732to whisper about in this world.                                            53
1149844The first supper--there would be another one                               54
1149948after midnight--was now being served, and Jordan                           54
1150049invited me to join her own party, who were spread                          54
1150148around a table on the other side of the garden.                            54
1150253There were three married couples and Jordan's escort,                      54
1150343a persistent undergraduate given to violent                                54
1150449innuendo, and obviously under the impression that                          54
1150548sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up                           54
1150653her person to a greater or lesser degree.  Instead of                      54
1150759rambling, this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity,                54
1150850and assumed to itself the function of representing                         54
1150944the staid nobility of the country-side--East                               54
1151044Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully                               54
1151143on guard against its spectroscopic gayety.                                 54
1151251"Let's get out,"  whispered Jordan, after a somehow                        54
1151347wasteful and inappropriate half-hour.  "This is                            54
1151425much too polite for me."                                                   54
1151548We got  up, and she explained that we were going                           54
1151653to find the host:  I had never met him, she said, and                      54
1151743it was making me uneasy.  The undergraduate                                54
1151837nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.                                       54
1151945The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded,                              54
1152048but Gatsby was not there.  She couldn't find him                           54
1152147from the top of the steps, and he wasn't on the                            54
1152251veranda.  On a chance we tried an important-looking                        54
1152344door, and walked into a high Gothic library,                               54
1152446panelled with carved English oak, and probably                             54
1152546transported complete from some ruin overseas.                              54
1152648A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed                           54
1152741spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on                                  55
1152862the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration             55
1152939at the shelves of books.  As we entered                                    55
1153047he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan                            55
1153119from head to foot.                                                         55
1153247"What do you think?"  he demanded impetuously.                             55
1153314"About what?"                                                              55
1153443He waved his hand toward the book-shelves.                                 55
1153545"About that.  As a matter of fact you needn't                              55
1153653bother to ascertain.  I ascertained.  They're real."                       55
1153713"The books?"                                                               55
1153811He nodded.                                                                 55
1153947"Absolutely real--have pages and everything.  I                            55
1154051thought they'd be a nice durable cardboard.  Matter                        55
1154154of fact, they're absolutely real.  Pages and--  Here]                      55
1154217Lemme show you."                                                           55
1154347Taking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to                            55
1154449the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the                          55
1154521"Stoddard Lectures."                                                       55
1154649"See]"  he cried triumphantly.  "It's a bona-fide                          55
1154753piece of printed matter.  It fooled me.  This fella's                      55
1154856a regular Belasco.  It's a triumph.  What thoroughness]                    55
1154945What realism]  Knew when to stop, too--didn't                              55
1155038cut the pages.  But what do you want?                                      55
1155121What do you expect?"                                                       55
1155244He snatched the book from me and replaced it                               55
1155353hastily on its shelf, muttering that if one brick was                      55
1155450removed the whole library was liable to collapse.                          55
1155545"Who brought you?"  he demanded.  "Or did you                              56
1155644just come?  I was brought.  Most people were                               56
1155710brought."                                                                  56
1155849Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without                          56
1155911answering.                                                                 56
1156043"I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,"                                56
1156145he continued.  "Mrs. Claud Roosevelt.  Do you                              56
1156248know her?  I met her somewhere last night.  I've                           56
1156349been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it                          56
1156440might sober me up to sit in a library."                                    56
1156510"Has it?"                                                                  56
1156653"A little bit, I think.  I can't tell yet.  I've only                      56
1156752been here an hour.  Did I tell you about the books?                        56
1156827They're real.  They're----"                                                56
1156915"You told us."                                                             56
1157045We shook hands with him gravely and went back                              56
1157110outdoors.                                                                  56
1157250There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden;                         56
1157339old men pushing young girls backward in                                    56
1157451eternal graceless circles, superior couples holding                        56
1157550each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in                         56
1157655the corners--and a great number of single girls dancing                    56
1157750individualistically or relieving the orchestra for                         56
1157850a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps.                          56
1157953By midnight the hilarity had increased.  A celebrated                      56
1158042tenor had sung in Italian, and a notorious                                 56
1158151contralto had sung in jazz, and between the numbers                        56
1158247people were doing "stunts" all over the garden,                            56
1158351while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward                        56
1158450the summer sky.  A pair of stage twins, who turned                         57
1158557out to be the girls in yellow, did a baby act in costume,                  57
1158642and champagne was served in glasses bigger                                 57
1158750than finger-bowls.  The moon had risen higher, and                         57
1158854floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales,                     57
1158950trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the                         57
1159021banjoes on the lawn.                                                       57
1159150I was still with Jordan Baker.  We were sitting at                         57
1159246a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy                             57
1159356little girl, who gave way upon the slightest provocation                   57
1159443to uncontrollable laughter.  I was enjoying                                57
1159555myself now.  I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne,                    57
1159640and the scene had changed before my eyes                                   57
1159753into something significant, elemental, and profound.                       57
1159848At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at                           57
1159915me and smiled.                                                             57
1160054"Your face is familiar,"  he said, politely.  "Weren't                     57
1160143you in the Third Division during the war?"                                 57
1160255"Why, yes.  I was in the Ninth MACHINE-gun Battalion."                     57
1160361"I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen.               57
1160439I knew I'd seen you somewhere before."                                     57
1160543We talked for a moment about some wet, gray                                57
1160654little villages in France.  Evidently he lived in this                     57
1160750vicinity, for he told me that he had just bought a                         57
1160846hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the                             57
1160909morning.                                                                   57
1161046"Want to go with me, old sport?  Just near the                             57
1161124shore along the Sound."                                                    57
1161213"What time?"                                                               58
1161332"Any time that suits you best."                                            58
1161446It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name                             58
1161538when Jordan looked around and smiled.                                      58
1161640"Having a gay time now?"  she inquired.                                    58
1161755"Much better."  I turned again to my new acquaintance.                     58
1161836"This is an unusual party for me.  I                                       58
1161951haven't even seen the host.  I live over there----"                        58
1162055I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance,                    58
1162166"and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation."          58
1162247For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to                            58
1162312understand.                                                                58
1162433"I'm Gatsby,"  he said suddenly.                                           58
1162548"What]"  I exclaimed.  "Oh, I beg your pardon."                            58
1162647"I thought you knew, old sport.  I'm afraid I'm                            58
1162723not a very good host."                                                     58
1162859He smiled understandingly--much more than understandingly.                 58
1162936It was one of those rare smiles with                                       58
1163052a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may                       58
1163153come across four or five times in life.  It faced--or                      58
1163256seemed to face--the whole external world for an instant,                   58
1163349and then concentrated on you with an irresistible                          58
1163448prejudice in your favor.  It understood you just                           58
1163550so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in                         58
1163657you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured                  58
1163747you that it had precisely the impression of you                            58
1163851that, at your best, you hoped to convey.  Precisely                        58
1163950at that point it vanished--and I was looking at an                         58
1164052elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty,                       59
1164147whose elaborate formality of speech just missed                            59
1164253being absurd.  Some time before he introduced himself                      59
1164347I'd got a strong impression that he was picking                            59
1164421his words with care.                                                       59
1164547Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified                            59
1164657himself, a butler hurried toward him with the information                  59
1164742that Chicago was calling him on the wire.                                  59
1164849He excused himself with a small bow that included                          59
1164920each of us in turn.                                                        59
1165050"If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,"                         59
1165153he urged me.  "Excuse me.  I will rejoin you later."                       59
1165260When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan--constrained               59
1165332to assure her of my surprise.  I                                           59
1165450had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and                         59
1165538corpulent person in his middle years.                                      59
1165642"Who is he?"  I demanded.  "Do you know?"                                  59
1165732"He's just a man named Gatsby."                                            59
1165844"Where is he from, I mean?  And what does he                               59
1165905do?"                                                                       59
1166050"Now you're started on the subject,"  she answered                         59
1166141with a wan smile.  "Well, he told me once                                  59
1166223he was an Oxford man."                                                     59
1166345A dim background started to take shape behind                              59
1166443him, but at her next remark it faded away.                                 59
1166531"However, I don't believe it."                                             59
1166611"Why not?"                                                                 59
1166751"I don't know,"  she insisted,  "I just don't think                        59
1166816he went there."                                                            59
1166946Something in her tone reminded me of the other                             60
1167053girl's "I think he killed a man,"  and had the effect                      60
1167151of stimulating my curiosity.  I would have accepted                        60
1167251without question the information that Gatsby sprang                        60
1167346from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower                             60
1167449East Side of New York.  That was comprehensible.                           60
1167547But young men didn't--at least in my provincial                            60
1167653inexperience I believed they didn't--drift coolly out                      60
1167750of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.                          60
1167847"Anyhow, he gives large parties,"  said Jordan,                            60
1167952changing the subject with an urbane distaste for the                       60
1168060concrete.  "And I like large parties.  They're so intimate.                60
1168143At small parties there isn't any privacy."                                 60
1168248There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice                           60
1168351of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the                        60
1168425echolalia of the garden.                                                   60
1168551"Ladies and gentlemen,"  he cried.  "At the request                        60
1168642of Mr. Gatsby we are going to play for you                                 60
1168751Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's latest work, which attracted                        60
1168848so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May.  If                           60
1168958you read the papers, you know there was a big sensation."                  60
1169040He smiled with jovial condescension, and                                   60
1169146added:  "Some sensation]"  Whereupon everybody                             60
1169209laughed.                                                                   60
1169349"The piece is known,"  he concluded lustily,  "as                          60
1169449'Vladimir Tostoff's Jazz History of the World.'"                           60
1169546The nature of Mr. Tostoff's composition eluded                             60
1169652me, because just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby,                       60
1169751standing alone on the marble steps and looking from                        60
1169853one group to another with approving eyes.  His tanned                      61
1169953skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his                      61
1170049short hair looked as though it were trimmed every                          61
1170157day.  I could see nothing sinister about him.  I wondered                  61
1170246if the fact that he was not drinking helped to                             61
1170353set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that                      61
1170458he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased.                  61
1170540When the "Jazz History of the World" was                                   61
1170655over, girls were putting their heads on men's shoulders                    61
1170749in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning                          61
1170845backward playfully into men's arms, even into                              61
1170948groups, knowing that some one would arrest their                           61
1171045falls--but no one swooned backward on Gatsby,                              61
1171148and no French bob touched Gatsby's shoulder, and                           61
1171250no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby's head                         61
1171314for one link.                                                              61
1171421"I beg your pardon."                                                       61
1171549Gatsby's butler was suddenly standing beside us.                           61
1171648"Miss Baker?"  he inquired.  "I beg your pardon,                           61
1171750but Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you alone."                          61
1171839"With me?"  she exclaimed in surprise.                                     61
1171915"Yes, madame."                                                             61
1172048She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in                           61
1172148astonishment, and followed the butler toward the                           61
1172250house.  I noticed that she wore her evening-dress,                         61
1172349all her dresses, like sports clothes--there was a                          61
1172450jauntiness about her movements as if she had first                         61
1172549learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp                          61
1172610mornings.                                                                  61
1172749I was alone and it was almost two.  For some time                          62
1172848confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a                           62
1172943long, many-windowed room which overhung the                                62
1173049terrace.  Eluding Jordan's undergraduate, who was                          62
1173151now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two                        62
1173248chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I                           62
1173313went inside.                                                               62
1173446The large room was full of people.  One of the                             62
1173549girls in yellow was playing the piano, and beside                          62
1173646her stood a tall, red-haired young lady from a                             62
1173748famous chorus, engaged in song.  She had drunk a                           62
1173847quantity of champagne, and during the course of                            62
1173950her song she had decided, ineptly, that everything                         62
1174049was very, very sad--she was not only singing, she                          62
1174147was weeping too.  Whenever there was a pause in                            62
1174249the song she filled it with gasping, broken sobs,                          62
1174357and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano.                   62
1174438The tears coursed down her cheeks--not                                     62
1174548freely, however, for when they came into contact                           62
1174646with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed                             62
1174748an inky color, and pursued the rest of their way                           62
1174850in slow black rivulets.  A humorous suggestion was                         62
1174951made that she sing the notes on her face, whereupon                        62
1175051she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and went                        62
1175130off into a deep vinous sleep.                                              62
1175245"She had a fight with a man who says he's her                              62
1175341husband,"  explained a girl at my elbow.                                   62
1175445I looked around.  Most of the remaining women                              62
1175548were now having fights with men said to be their                           62
1175648husbands.  Even Jordan's party, the quartet from                           63
1175747East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension.  One                            63
1175848of the men was talking with curious intensity to                           63
1175950a young actress, and his wife, after attempting to                         63
1176053laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent                      63
1176158way, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks--at                 63
1176238intervals she appeared suddenly at his                                     63
1176372side like an angry diamond, and hissed:  "You promised]"  into his ear.    63
1176445the reluctance to go home was not confined to                              63
1176546wayward men.  The hall was at present occupied                             63
1176654by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant                     63
1176740wives.  The wives were sympathizing with                                   63
1176838each other in slightly raised voices.                                      63
1176943"Whenever he sees I'm having a good time he                                63
1177019wants to go home."                                                         63
1177146"Never heard anything so selfish in my life."                              63
1177240"We're always the first ones to leave."                                    63
1177313"So are we."                                                               63
1177449"Well, we're almost the last to-night,"  said one                          63
1177551of the men sheepishly.  "The orchestra left half an                        63
1177611hour ago."                                                                 63
1177754In spite of the wives' agreement that such malevolence                     63
1177841was beyond credibility, the dispute ended                                  63
1177948in a short struggle, and both wives were lifted,                           63
1178025kicking, into the night.                                                   63
1178150As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the                         63
1178247library opened and Jordan Baker and Gatsby came                            63
1178351out together.  He was saying some last word to her,                        63
1178450but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly                         64
1178550into formality as several people approached him to                         64
1178613say good-by.                                                               64
1178746Jordan's party were calling impatiently to her                             64
1178848from the porch, but she lingered for a moment to                           64
1178913shake hands.                                                               64
1179046"I've just heard the most amazing thing,"  she                             64
1179141whispered.  "How long were we in there?"                                   64
1179222"Why, about an hour."                                                      64
1179354"It was--simply amazing,"  she repeated abstractedly.                      64
1179440"But I swore I wouldn't tell it and here                                   64
1179551I am tantalizing you."  She yawned gracefully in my                        64
1179650face:  "Please come and see me. . . . Phone book.                          64
1179747. . . Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard.                             64
1179850. . . My aunt. . . ."  she was hurrying off as she                         64
1179947talked--her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as                            64
1180039she melted into her party at the door.                                     64
1180144Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I                               64
1180249had stayed so late, I joined the last of Gatsby's                          64
1180348guests, who were clustered around him.  I wanted                           64
1180455to explain that I'd hunted for him early in the evening                    64
1180544and to apologize for not having known him in                               64
1180612the garden.                                                                64
1180745"Don't mention it,"  he enjoined me eagerly.                               64
1180848"Don't give it another thought, old sport."  The                           64
1180949familiar expression held no more familiarity than                          64
1181049the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder.                           64
1181150"And don't forget we're going up in the hydroplane                         64
1181237to-morrow morning, at nine o'clock."                                       64
1181337Then the butler, behind his shoulder:                                      65
1181445"Philadelphia wants you on the 'phone, sir."                               65
1181549"All right, in a minute.  Tell them I'll be right                          65
1181626there. . . . good night."                                                  65
1181714"Good night."                                                              65
1181844"Good night."  He smiled--and suddenly there                               65
1181951seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been                        65
1182053among the last to go, as if he had desired it all the                      65
1182150time.  "Good night, old sport. . . . good night."                          65
1182245But as I walked down the steps I saw that the                              65
1182348evening was not quite over.  Fifty feet from the                           65
1182449door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and                          65
1182548tumultuous scene.  In the ditch beside the road,                           65
1182648right side up, but violently shorn of one wheel,                           65
1182748rested a new coupe which had left Gatsby's drive                           65
1182848not two minutes before.  The sharp jut of a wall                           65
1182949accounted for the detatchment of the wheel, which                          65
1183050was now getting considerable attention from half a                         65
1183147dozen curious chauffeurs.  However, as they had                            65
1183254left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant                     65
1183358din from those in the rear had been audible for some time,                 65
1183445and added to the already violent confusion of                              65
1183511the scene.                                                                 65
1183646A man in a long duster had dismounted from the                             65
1183754wreck and now stood in the middle of the road, looking                     65
1183849from the car to the tire and from the tire to the                          65
1183938observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.                                      65
1184047"See]"  he explained.  "It went in the ditch."                             65
1184149The fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I                          65
1184251recognized first the unusual quality of wonder, and                        66
1184348then the man--it was the late patron of Gatsby's                           66
1184409library.                                                                   66
1184519"How'd it happen?"                                                         66
1184627He shrugged his shoulders.                                                 66
1184746"I know nothing whatever about mechanics,"  he                             66
1184817said decisively.                                                           66
1184945"But how did it happen?  Did you run into the                              66
1185007wall?"                                                                     66
1185149"Don't ask me,"  said Owl Eyes, washing his hands                          66
1185247of the whole matter.  "I know very little about                            66
1185350driving--next to nothing.  It happened, and that's                         66
1185413all I know."                                                               66
1185546"Well, if you're a poor driver you oughtn't to                             66
1185623try driving at night."                                                     66
1185754"But I wasn't even trying,"  he explained indignantly,                     66
1185824"I wasn't even trying."                                                    66
1185939An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.                                     66
1186033"Do you want to commit suicide?"                                           66
1186148"You're lucky it was just a wheel]  A bad driver                           66
1186222and not even trying]"                                                      66
1186349"You don't understand,"  explained the criminal.                           66
1186453"I wasn't driving.  There's another man in the car."                       66
1186546The shock that followed this declaration found                             66
1186650voice in a sustained "Ah-h-h]"  as the door of the                         66
1186749coupe swung slowly open.  The crowd--it was now a                          66
1186847crowd--stepped back involuntarily, and when the                            66
1186948door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause.                            66
1187052Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale, dangling                       66
1187155individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively                    67
1187244at the ground with a large uncertain dancing                               67
1187306shoe.                                                                      67
1187451Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused                        67
1187543by the incessant groaning of the horns, the                                67
1187647apparition stood swaying for a moment before he                            67
1187733perceived the man in the duster.                                           67
1187845"Wha's matter?"  he inquired calmly.  "Did we                              67
1187915run outa gas?"                                                             67
1188008"Look]"                                                                    67
1188145Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated                              67
1188245wheel--he stared at it for a moment, and then                              67
1188348looked upward as though he suspected that it had                           67
1188422dropped from the sky.                                                      67
1188536"It came off,"  some one explained.                                        67
1188611He nodded.                                                                 67
1188739"At first I din' notice we'd stopped."                                     67
1188854A pause.  Then, taking a long breath and straightening                     67
1188942his shoulders, he remarked in a determined                                 67
1189006voice:                                                                     67
1189154"Wonder'ff tell me where there's a gas'line station?"                      67
1189248At least a dozen men, some of them little better                           67
1189348off than he was, explained to him that wheel and                           67
1189448car were no longer joined by any physical bond.                            67
1189547"Back out,"  he suggested after a moment.  "Put                            67
1189617her in reverse."                                                           67
1189723"But the wheel's off]"                                                     67
1189814He hesitated.                                                              67
1189931"No harm in trying,"  he said.                                             68
1190046The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo                             68
1190148and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward                           68
1190246home.  I glanced back once.  A wafer of a moon                             68
1190349was shining over Gatsby's house, making the night                          68
1190450fine as before, and surviving the laughter and the                         68
1190554sound of his still glowing garden.  A sudden emptiness                     68
1190643seemed to flow now from the windows and the                                68
1190749great doors, endowing with complete isolation the                          68
1190852figure of the host, who stood on the porch, his hand                       68
1190936up in a formal gesture of farewell.                                        68
1191048Reading over what I have written so far, I see I                           68
1191150have given the impression that the events of three                         68
1191254nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me.                      68
1191347On the contrary, they were merely casual events                            68
1191448in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they                           68
1191554absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.                      68
1191648Most of the time I worked.  In the early morning                           68
1191745the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried                              68
1191846down the white chasms of lower New York to the                             68
1191949Probity Trust.  I knew the other clerks and young                          68
1192047bond-salesmen by their first names, and lunched                            68
1192148with them in dark, crowded restaurants on little                           68
1192247pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee.  I                            68
1192348even had a short affair with a girl who lived in                           68
1192452Jersey City and worked in the accounting department,                       68
1192541but her brother began throwing mean looks                                  68
1192649in my direction, so when she went on her vacation                          69
1192736in July I let it blow quietly away.                                        69
1192848I took dinner usually at the Yale Club--for some                           69
1192948reason it was the gloomiest event of my day--and                           69
1193060then I went up-stairs to the library and studied investments               69
1193141and securities for a conscientious hour.                                   69
1193251There were generally a few rioters around, but they                        69
1193351never came into the library, so it was a good place                        69
1193448to work.  After that, if the night was mellow, I                           69
1193548strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray                           69
1193651Hill Hotel, and over 33d Street to the Pennsylvania                        69
1193709Station.                                                                   69
1193847I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous                            69
1193959feel of it at night, and the satisfaction that the constant                69
1194043flicker of men and women and machines gives                                69
1194153to the restless eye.  I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue                      69
1194246and pick out romantic women from the crowd and                             69
1194350imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter                         69
1194460into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove.                69
1194538Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them                                     69
1194653to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets,                      69
1194749and they turned and smiled back at me before they                          69
1194848faded through a door into warm darkness.  At the                           69
1194949enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting                          69
1195049loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others--poor                          69
1195153young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting                      69
1195257until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner--young                  69
1195345clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant                              69
1195427moments of night and life.                                                 69
1195550Again at eight o'clock, when the dark lanes of the                         70
1195648Forties were five deep with throbbing taxi-cabs,                           70
1195748bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking                           70
1195851in my heart.  Forms leaned together in the taxis as                        70
1195952they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter                       70
1196066from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes outlined unintelligible         70
1196144gestures inside.  Imagining that I, too, was                               70
1196249hurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate                          70
1196332excitement, I wished them well.                                            70
1196450For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then                         70
1196547in midsummer I found her again.  At first I was                            70
1196650flattered to go places with her, because she was a                         70
1196744golf champion, and every one knew her name.                                70
1196849Then it was something more.  I wasn't actually in                          70
1196955love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity.  The bored                    70
1197051haughty face that she turned to the world concealed                        70
1197146something--most affectations conceal something                             70
1197256eventually, even though they don't in the beginning--and                   70
1197342one day I found what it was.  When we were                                 70
1197451on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a                        70
1197551borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and                        70
1197649then lied about it--and suddenly I remembered the                          70
1197748story about her that had eluded me that night at                           70
1197854Daisy's.  At her first big golf tournament there was a                     70
1197952row that nearly reached the newspapers--a suggestion                       70
1198045that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in                              70
1198147the semi-final round.  The thing approached the                            70
1198244proportions of a scandal--then died away.  A                               70
1198349caddy retracted his statement, and the only other                          70
1198451witness admitted that he might have been mistaken.                         71
1198538The incident and the name had remained                                     71
1198621together in my mind.                                                       71
1198749Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd                          71
1198849men, and now I saw that this was because she felt                          71
1198949safer on a plane where any divergence from a code                          71
1199047would be thought impossible.  She was incurably                            71
1199148dishonest.  She wasn't able to endure being at a                           71
1199253disadvantage and, given this unwillingness, I suppose                      71
1199345she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she                              71
1199451was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent                        71
1199553smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands                      71
1199626of her hard, jaunty body.                                                  71
1199745It made no difference to me.  Dishonesty in a                              71
1199846woman is a thing you never blame deeply--i was                             71
1199950casually sorry, and then I forgot.  It was on that                         71
1200051same house party that we had a curious conversation                        71
1200144about driving a car.  It started because she                               71
1200247passed so close to some workmen that our fender                            71
1200336flicked a button on one man's coat.                                        71
1200452"You're a rotten driver,"  I protested.  "Either you                       71
1200550ought to be more careful, or you oughtn't to drive                         71
1200609at all."                                                                   71
1200716"I am careful."                                                            71
1200818"No, you're not."                                                          71
1200945"Well, other people are,"  she said lightly.                               71
1201033"What's that got to do with it?"                                           71
1201149"They'll keep out of my way,"  she insisted.  "It                          71
1201232takes two to make an accident."                                            71
1201345"Suppose you met somebody just as careless as                              72
1201411yourself."                                                                 72
1201555"I hope I never will,"  she answered.  "I hate careless                    72
1201633people.  That's why I like you."                                           72
1201750Her gray, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead,                         72
1201851but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and                        72
1201959for a moment I thought I loved her.  But I am slow-thinking                72
1202045and full of interior rules that act as brakes                              72
1202149on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get                          72
1202248myself definitely out of that tangle back home.                            72
1202348I'd been writing letters once a week and signing                           72
1202449them:  "Love, Nick," and all I could think of was                          72
1202550how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint                         72
1202652mustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip.                        72
1202749Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that                          72
1202850had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.                          72
1202949Every one suspects himself of at least one of the                          72
1203052cardinal virtues, and this is mine:  I am one of the                       72
1203142few honest people that I have ever known.                                  72
1203210CHAPTER IV                                                                 73
1203348ON Sunday morning while church bells rang in the                           73
1203456villages alongshore, the world and its mistress returned                   73
1203542to Gatsby's house and twinkled hilariously                                 73
1203613on his lawn.                                                               73
1203750"He's a bootlegger," said the young ladies, moving                         73
1203849somewhere between his cocktails and his flowers.                           73
1203948"One time he killed a man who had found out that                           73
1204042he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second                                 73
1204149cousin to the devil.  Reach me a rose, honey, and                          73
1204252pour me a last drop into that there crystal glass."                        73
1204353Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a time-table                      73
1204439the names of those who came to Gatsby's                                    73
1204563house that summer.  It is an old time-table now, disintegrating            73
1204639at its folds, and headed "This schedule                                    73
1204752in effect July 5th, 1922."  But I can still read the                       73
1204854gray names, and they will give you a better impression                     73
1204942than my generalities of those who accepted                                 73
1205052Gatsby's hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute                       73
1205139of knowing nothing whatever about him.                                     73
1205245From East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers                              73
1205345and the Leeches, and a man named Bunsen, whom                              73
1205449I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who was                          73
1205551drowned last summer up in Maine.  And the Hornbeams                        73
1205642and the Willie Voltaires, and a whole clan                                 73
1205748named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a corner                           73
1205850and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever                         74
1205944came near.  And the Ismays and the Chrysties                               74
1206045(or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr. Chrystie's                              74
1206146wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say,                             74
1206247turned cotton-white one winter afternoon for no                            74
1206320good reason at all.                                                        74
1206450Clarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember.                          74
1206543He came only once, in white knickerbockers,                                74
1206644and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the                               74
1206748garden.  From farther out on the Island came the                           74
1206845Cheadles and the O. R. P. Schraeders, and the                              74
1206955Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the Fishguards                    74
1207045and the Ripley Snells.  Snell was there three                              74
1207149days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk                          74
1207249out on the gravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett's                          74
1207348automobile ran over his right hand.  The Dancies                           74
1207449came, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over                          74
1207549sixty, and Maurice A. Flink, and the Hammerheads,                          74
1207653and Beluga the tobacco importer, and Beluga's girls.                       74
1207746From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys                             74
1207845and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick                              74
1207951the state senator and Newton Orchid, who controlled                        74
1208038Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and                                     74
1208153Clyde Cohen and Don S. Schwartze (the son) and Arthur                      74
1208245MCcarty, all connected with the movies in one                              74
1208349way or another.  And the Catlips and the Bembergs                          74
1208448and G. Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who                           74
1208554afterward strangled his wife.  Da Fontano the promoter                     74
1208639came there, and Ed Legros and James B.                                     74
1208746("Rot-Gut") Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest                             75
1208852Lilly--they came to gamble, and when Ferret wandered                       75
1208943into the garden it meant he was cleaned out                                75
1209047and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate                            75
1209121profitably next day.                                                       75
1209243A man named Klipspringer was there so often                                75
1209352and so long that he became known as "the boarder"--i                       75
1209446doubt if he had any other home.  Of theatrical                             75
1209548people there were Gus Waize and Horace O'donavan                           75
1209640and Lester Meyer and George Duckweed and                                   75
1209750Francis Bull.  Also from New York were the Chromes                         75
1209849and the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel                          75
1209949Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehers and the                          75
1210048Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the                           75
1210147Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and                            75
1210248Henry L. Palmetto, who killed himself by jumping                           75
1210344in front of a subway train in Times Square.                                75
1210441Benny MCclenahan arrived always with four                                  75
1210555girls.  They were never quite the same ones in physical                    75
1210651person, but they were so identical one with another                        75
1210745that it inevitably seemed they had been there                              75
1210851before.  I have forgotten their names--Jaqueline, I                        75
1210951think, or else Consuela, or Gloria or Judy or June,                        75
1211046and their last names were either the melodious                             75
1211147names of flowers and months or the sterner ones                            75
1211251of the great American capitalists whose cousins, if                        75
1211346pressed, they would confess themselves to be.                              75
1211444In addition to all these I can remember that                               75
1211549Faustina O'brien came there at least once and the                          75
1211649Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who had his nose                          76
1211752shot off in the war, and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss                       76
1211850Haag, his fiancee, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr.                          76
1211948P. Jewett, once head of the American Legion, and                           76
1212046Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be her                             76
1212145chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we                              76
1212249called Duke, and whose name, if I ever knew it, I                          76
1212316have forgotten.                                                            76
1212446All these people came to Gatsby's house in the                             76
1212508summer.                                                                    76
1212651At nine o'clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby's                        76
1212745gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my                              76
1212856door and gave out a burst of melody from its three-noted                   76
1212945horn.  It was the first time he had called on                              76
1213052me, though I had gone to two of his parties, mounted                       76
1213149in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation,                          76
1213232made frequent use of his beach.                                            76
1213346"Good morning, old sport.  You're having lunch                             76
1213453with me to-day and I thought we'd ride up together."                       76
1213548He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his                           76
1213652car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so                       76
1213748peculiarly American--that comes, I suppose, with                           76
1213869the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth and, even more,      76
1213948with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic                           76
1214045games.  This quality was continually breaking                              76
1214161through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness.               76
1214242He was never quite still; there was always                                 76
1214349a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening                          77
1214423and closing of a hand.                                                     77
1214546He saw me looking with admiration at his car.                              77
1214650"It's pretty, isn't it, old sport?"  He jumped off                         77
1214749to give me a better view.  "Haven't you ever seen                          77
1214812it before?"                                                                77
1214951I'd seen it.  Everybody had seen it.  It was a rich                        77
1215049cream color, bright with nickel, swollen here and                          77
1215155there in its monstrous length with triumphant hat-boxes                    77
1215245and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced                              77
1215346with a labyrinth of wind-shields that mirrored                             77
1215449a dozen suns.  Sitting down behind many layers of                          77
1215549glass in a sort of green leather conservatory, we                          77
1215617started to town.                                                           77
1215748I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times                           77
1215850in the past month and found, to my disappointment,                         77
1215956that he had little to say:  So my first impression, that                   77
1216050he was a person of some undefined consequence, had                         77
1216155gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor                    77
1216238of an elaborate road-house next door.                                      77
1216342And then came that disconcerting ride.  We                                 77
1216445hadn't reached West Egg village before Gatsby                              77
1216550began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and                         77
1216648slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his                           77
1216722caramel-colored suit.                                                      77
1216852"Look here, old sport,"  he broke out surprisingly.                        77
1216937"What's your opinion of me, anyhow?"                                       77
1217054A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions                     77
1217130which that question deserves.                                              77
1217247"Well, I'm going to tell you something about my                            78
1217351life,"  he interrupted.  "I don't want you to get a                        78
1217451wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear."                         78
1217547So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that                            78
1217636flavored conversation in his halls.                                        78
1217753"I'll tell you God's truth."  His right hand suddenly                      78
1217843ordered divine retribution to stand by.  "I                                78
1217947am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle                            78
1218048West--all dead now.  I was brought up in America                           78
1218148but educated at Oxford, because all my ancestors                           78
1218249have been educated there for many years.  It is a                          78
1218319family tradition."                                                         78
1218447He looked at me sideways--and I knew why Jordan                            78
1218544Baker had believed he was lying.  He hurried                               78
1218649the phrase "educated at Oxford," or swallowed it,                          78
1218755or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before.                     78
1218845And with this doubt, his whole statement fell                              78
1218951to pieces, and I wondered if there wasn't something                        78
1219040a little sinister about him, after all.                                    78
1219143"What part of the Middle West?"  I inquired                                78
1219210casually.                                                                  78
1219317"San Francisco."                                                           78
1219409"I see."                                                                   78
1219547"My family all died and I came into a good deal                            78
1219611of money."                                                                 78
1219746His voice was solemn, as if the memory of that                             78
1219851sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him.  For                        78
1219948a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg,                           78
1220044but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.                                78
1220149"After that I lived like a young rajah in all the                          79
1220251capitals of EUROPE--paris, Venice, Rome--collecting                        79
1220350jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting                         79
1220447a little, things for myself only, and trying to                            79
1220549forget something very sad that had happened to me                          79
1220611long ago."                                                                 79
1220751With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous                        79
1220840laughter.  The very phrases were worn so                                   79
1220948threadbare that they evoked no image except that                           79
1221050of a turbaned "character" leaking sawdust at every                         79
1221146pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de                             79
1221210Boulogne.                                                                  79
1221346"Then came the war, old sport.  It was a great                             79
1221453relief, and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to                      79
1221548bear an enchanted life.  I accepted a commission                           79
1221650as first lieutenant when it began.  In the Argonne                         79
1221742Forest I took two machine-gun detatchments                                 79
1221845so far forward that there was a half mile gap                              79
1221948on either side of us where the infantry couldn't                           79
1222050advance.  We stayed there two days and two nights,                         79
1222149a hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns,                          79
1222248and when the infantry came up at last they found                           79
1222348the insignia of three German divisions among the                           79
1222449piles of dead.  I was promoted to be a major, and                          79
1222550every Allied government gave me a decoration--even                         79
1222657Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea]"                   79
1222746Little Montenegro]  He lifted up the words and                             79
1222855nodded at them--with his smile.  The smile comprehended                    79
1222945Montenegro's troubled history and sympathized                              80
1223043with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin                                80
1223151people.  It appreciated fully the chain of national                        80
1223245circumstances which had elicited this tribute                              80
1223352from Montenegro's warm little heart.  My incredulity                       80
1223446was submerged in fascination now;  it was like                             80
1223544skimming hastily through a dozen magazines.                                80
1223647He reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal,                            80
1223738slung on a ribbon, fell into my palm.                                      80
1223834"That's the one from Montenegro."                                          80
1223946To my astonishment, the thing had an authentic                             80
1224052look.  "Orderi di Danilo,"  ran the circular legend,                       80
1224127"Montenegro, Nicolas Rex."                                                 80
1224211"Turn it."                                                                 80
1224357"Major Jay Gatsby,"  I read, "For Valour Extraordinary."                   80
1224449"Here's another thing I always carry.  A souvenir                          80
1224550of Oxford days.  It was taken in Trinity Quad--the                         80
1224646man on my left is now the Earl of Dorcaster."                              80
1224745It was a photograph of half a dozen young men                              80
1224851in blazers loafing in an archway through which were                        80
1224952visible a host of spires.  There was Gatsby, looking                       80
1225050a little, not much, younger--with a cricket bat in                         80
1225110his hand.                                                                  80
1225248Then it was all true.  I saw the skins of tigers                           80
1225348flaming in his palace on the Grand Canal;  I saw                           80
1225449him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with their                          80
1225550crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken                         80
1225607heart.                                                                     80
1225748"I'm going to make a big request of you to-day,"                           81
1225851he said, pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction,                        81
1225947"so I thought you ought to know something about                            81
1226055me. I didn't want you to think I was just some nobody.                     81
1226146You see, I usually find myself among strangers                             81
1226247because I drift here and there trying to forget                            81
1226351the sad thing that happened to me."  He hesitated.                         81
1226439"You'll hear about it this afternoon."                                     81
1226512"At lunch?"                                                                81
1226649"No, this afternoon.  I happened to find out that                          81
1226734you're taking Miss Baker to tea."                                          81
1226846"Do you mean you're in love with Miss Baker?"                              81
1226944"No, old sport, I'm not.  But Miss Baker has                               81
1227053kindly consented to speak to you about this matter."                       81
1227150I hadn't the faintest idea what "this matter" was,                         81
1227249but I was more annoyed than interested.  I hadn't                          81
1227347asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss Mr. Jay                            81
1227450Gatsby.  I was sure the request would be something                         81
1227551utterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I'd                        81
1227643ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn.                                 81
1227746He wouldn't say another word.  His correctness                             81
1227845grew on him as we neared the city.  We passed                              81
1227955Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-belted                    81
1228043ocean-going ships, and sped along a cobbled                                81
1228151slum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the                        81
1228249faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds.  Then the valley of                          81
1228347ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had                            81
1228448a glimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage                           81
1228542pump with panting vitality as we went by.                                  81
1228649With fenders spread like wings we scattered light                          82
1228759through half Long Island City--only half, for as we twisted                82
1228854among the pillars of the elevated I heard the familiar                     82
1228946"jug-jug-spat]" of a motorcycle, and a frantic                             82
1229026policeman rode alongside.                                                  82
1229150"All right, old sport,"  called Gatsby.  We slowed                         82
1229246down.  Taking a white card from his wallet, he                             82
1229332waved it before the man's eyes.                                            82
1229447"Right you are,"  agreed the policeman, tipping                            82
1229550his cap.  "Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby.  Excuse                         82
1229605me]"                                                                       82
1229746"What was that?"  I inquired.  "The picture of                             82
1229809Oxford?"                                                                   82
1229948"I was able to do the commissioner a favor once,                           82
1230046and he sends me a Christmas card every year."                              82
1230148Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through                           82
1230253the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving                      82
1230349cars, with the city rising up across the river in                          82
1230449white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish                          82
1230547out of non-olfactory money.  The city seen from                            82
1230649the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for                          82
1230760the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery               82
1230829and the beauty in the world.                                               82
1230944A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with                               82
1231052blooms, followed by two carriages with drawn blinds,                       82
1231148and by more cheerful carriages for friends.  The                           82
1231249friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and                          82
1231350short upper lips of southeastern Europe, and I was                         82
1231448glad that the sight of Gatsby's splendid car was                           82
1231548included in their sombre holiday.  As we crossed                           83
1231651Blackwell's Island a limousine passed us, driven by                        83
1231753a white chauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes,                      83
1231851two bucks and a girl.  I laughed aloud as the yolks                        83
1231955of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry.                     83
1232045"Anything can happen now that we've slid over                              83
1232152this bridge,"  I thought;  "anything at all. . . ."                        83
1232248even Gatsby could happen, without any particular                           83
1232308wonder.                                                                    83
1232444Roaring noon.  In a well-fanned Forty-second                               83
1232552Street cellar I met Gatsby for lunch.  Blinking away                       83
1232652the brightness of the street outside, my eyes picked                       83
1232753him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another                      83
1232805man.                                                                       83
1232949"Mr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem."                           83
1233049A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and                          83
1233147regarded me with two fine growths of hair which                            83
1233258luxuriated in either nostril.  After a moment I discovered                 83
1233336his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.                                        83
1233451"--So I took one look at him,"  said Mr. Wolfshiem,                        83
1233540shaking my hand earnestly,  "and what do                                   83
1233618you think I did?"                                                          83
1233730"What?"  I inquired politely.                                              83
1233846But evidently he was not addressing me, for he                             83
1233954dropped my hand and covered Gatsby with his expressive                     83
1234006nose.                                                                      83
1234143"I handed the money to Katspaugh and I sid:                                83
1234249'all right, Katspaugh, don't pay him a penny till                          84
1234350he shuts his mouth.'  He shut it then and there."                          84
1234450Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward                         84
1234544into the restaurant, whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem                               84
1234651swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed                        84
1234735into a somnambulatory abstraction.                                         84
1234837"Highballs?"  asked the head waiter.                                       84
1234954"This is a nice restaurant here,"  said Mr. Wolfshiem,                     84
1235041looking at the Presbyterian nymphs on the                                  84
1235149ceiling.  "But I like across the street better]"                           84
1235250"Yes, highballs,"  agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr.                          84
1235339Wolfshiem:  "It's too hot over there."                                     84
1235448"Hot and small--yes,"  said Mr. Wolfshiem,  "but                           84
1235519full of memories."                                                         84
1235632"What place is that?"  I asked.                                            84
1235720"The old Metropole.                                                        84
1235843"The old Metropole,"  brooded Mr. Wolfshiem                                84
1235952gloomily.  "Filled with faces dead and gone.  Filled                       84
1236054with friends gone now forever.  I can't forget so long                     84
1236152as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there.                        84
1236251It was six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and                        84
1236352drunk a lot all evening.  When it was almost morning                       84
1236443the waiter came up to him with a funny look                                84
1236549and says somebody wants to speak to him outside.                           84
1236652'all right,'  says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I                       84
1236730pulled him down in his chair.                                              84
1236849"'let the bastards come in here if they want you,                          84
1236950Rosy, but don't you, so help me, move outside this                         84
1237007room.'                                                                     84
1237148"It was four o'clock in the morning then, and if                           85
1237250we'd of raised the blinds we'd of seen daylight."                          85
1237334"Did he go?"  I asked innocently.                                          85
1237448"Sure he went."  Mr. Wolfshiem's nose flashed at                           85
1237550me indignantly.  "He turned around in the door and                         85
1237652says:  'Don't let that waiter take away my coffee]'                        85
1237747Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot                            85
1237851him three times in his full belly and drove away."                         85
1237956"Four of them were electrocuted,"  I said, remembering.                    85
1238050"Five, with Becker."  His nostrils turned to me in                         85
1238152an interested way.  "I understand you're looking for                       85
1238224a business gonnegtion."                                                    85
1238354The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling.                      85
1238423Gatsby answered for me:                                                    85
1238548"Oh, no,"  he exclaimed,  "this isn't the man."                            85
1238642"No?"  Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.                                  85
1238751"This is just a friend.  I told you we'd talk about                        85
1238823that some other time."                                                     85
1238949"I beg your pardon,"  said Mr. Wolfshiem,  "I had                          85
1239014a wrong man."                                                              85
1239144A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem,                               85
1239249forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the                          85
1239353old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy.                       85
1239449His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around                          85
1239552the room--he completed the arc by turning to inspect                       85
1239649the people directly behind.  I think that, except                          85
1239740for my presence, he would have taken one                                   85
1239836short glance beneath our own table.                                        85
1239945"Look here, old sport,"  said Gatsby, leaning                              86
1240048toward me, "I'm afraid I made you a little angry                           86
1240126this morning in the car."                                                  86
1240251There was the smile again, but this time I held out                        86
1240312against it.                                                                86
1240446"I don't like mysteries,"  I answered.  "And I                             86
1240547don't understand why you won't come out frankly                            86
1240649and tell me what you want.  Why has it all got to                          86
1240726come through Miss Baker?"                                                  86
1240846"Oh, it's nothing underhand,"  he assured me.                              86
1240948"Miss Baker's a great sportswoman, you know, and                           86
1241048she'd never do anything that wasn't all right."                            86
1241143Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up,                                86
1241247and hurried from the room, leaving me with Mr.                             86
1241324Wolfshiem at the table.                                                    86
1241457"He has to telephone,"  said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him                  86
1241540with his eyes.  "Fine fellow, isn't he?                                    86
1241646Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman."                              86
1241707"Yes."                                                                     86
1241824"He's an Oggsford man."                                                    86
1241906"Oh]"                                                                      86
1242045"He went to Oggsford College in England.  You                              86
1242124know Oggsford College?"                                                    86
1242220"I've heard of it."                                                        86
1242344"It's one of the most famous colleges in the                               86
1242408world."                                                                    86
1242543"Have you known Gatsby for a long time?"  I                                86
1242610inquired.                                                                  86
1242750"Several years,"  he answered in a gratified way.                          86
1242851"I made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after                        87
1242951the war.  But I knew I had discovered a man of fine                        87
1243052breeding after I talked with him an hour.  I said to                       87
1243152myself:  'There's the kind of man you'd like to take                       87
1243248home and introduce to your mother and sister.'"                            87
1243355He paused.  "I see you're looking at my cuff buttons."                     87
1243446I hadn't been looking at them, but I did now.                              87
1243546They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of                             87
1243607ivory.                                                                     87
1243748"Finest specimens of human molars,"  he informed                           87
1243804me.                                                                        87
1243954"Well]"  I inspected them.  "That's a very interesting                     87
1244007idea."                                                                     87
1244151"Yeah."  He flipped his sleeves up under his coat.                         87
1244245"Yeah, Gatsby's very careful about women.  He                              87
1244349would never so much as look at a friend's wife."                           87
1244451When the subject of this instinctive trust returned                        87
1244549to the table and sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his                          87
1244640coffee with a jerk and got to his feet.                                    87
1244746"I have enjoyed my lunch,"  he said,  "and I'm                             87
1244848going to run off from you two young men before I                           87
1244921outstay my welcome."                                                       87
1245056"Don't hurry, Meyer,"  said Gatsby, without enthusiasm.                    87
1245139Mr. Wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort                                    87
1245216of benediction.                                                            87
1245357"You're very polite, but I belong to another generation,"                  87
1245441he announced solemnly.  "You sit here and                                  87
1245545discuss your sports and your young ladies and                              87
1245653your----"  He supplied an imaginary noun with another                      88
1245747wave of his hand.  "As for me, I am fifty years                            88
1245851old, and I won't impose myself on you any longer."                         88
1245944As he shook hands and turned away his tragic                               88
1246054nose was trembling.  I wondered if I had said anything                     88
1246115to offend him.                                                             88
1246251"He becomes very sentimental sometimes,"  explained                        88
1246347Gatsby.  "This is one of his sentimental days.                             88
1246449He's quite a character around New York--a denizen                          88
1246514of Broadway."                                                              88
1246631"Who is he, anyhow, an actor?"                                             88
1246706"No."                                                                      88
1246813"A dentist?"                                                               88
1246947"Meyer Wolfshiem?  No, he's a gambler."  Gatsby                            88
1247048hesitated, then added coolly:  "He's the man who                           88
1247140fixed the World's Series back in 1919."                                    88
1247241"Fixed the World's Series?"  I repeated.                                   88
1247348The idea staggered me.  I remembered, of course,                           88
1247454that the World's Series had been fixed in 1919, but if                     88
1247553I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it                      88
1247659as a thing that merely happened, the end of some inevitable                88
1247740chain.  It never occurred to me that one                                   88
1247855man could start to play with the faith of fifty million                    88
1247947people--with the single-mindedness of a burglar                            88
1248016blowing a safe.                                                            88
1248146"How did he happen to do that?"  I asked after                             88
1248210a minute.                                                                  88
1248331"He just saw the opportunity."                                             88
1248424"Why isn't he in jail?"                                                    88
1248545"They can't get him, old sport.  He's a smart                              89
1248606man."                                                                      89
1248746I insisted on paying the check.  As the waiter                             89
1248848brought my change I caught sight of Tom Buchanan                           89
1248925across the crowded room.                                                   89
1249050"Come along with me for a minute,"  I said;  "I've                         89
1249131got to say hello to some one."                                             89
1249244When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a                               89
1249330dozen steps in our direction.                                              89
1249443"Where've you been?"  he demamded eagerly.                                 89
1249549"Daisy's furious because you haven't called up."                           89
1249636"This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan."                                        89
1249752They shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar                       89
1249840look of embarrassment came over Gatsby's                                   89
1249906face.                                                                      89
1250043"How've you been, anyhow?"  demanded Tom of                                89
1250145me.  "How'd you happen to come up this far to                              89
1250206eat?"                                                                      89
1250342"I've been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby."                                  89
1250448I turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer                           89
1250507there.                                                                     89
1250641One October day in nineteen-seventeen----                                  89
1250750(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very                         89
1250853straight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the                      89
1250912Plaza Hotel)                                                               89
1251053--i was walking along from one place to another, half                      89
1251154on the sidewalks and half on the lawns.  I was happier                     89
1251240on the lawns because I had on shoes from                                   90
1251346England with rubber nobs on the soles that bit                             90
1251449into the soft ground.  I had on a new plaid skirt                          90
1251549also that blew a little in the wind, and whenever                          90
1251649this happened the red, white, and blue banners in                          90
1251752front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said                       90
1251840tut-tut-tut-tut, in a disapproving way.                                    90
1251949The largest of the banners and the largest of the                          90
1252050lawns belonged to Daisy Fay's house.  She was just                         90
1252149eighteen, two years older than me, and by far the                          90
1252251most popular of all the young girls in Louisville.                         90
1252354She dressed in white, and had a little white roadster,                     90
1252452and all day long the telephone rang in her house and                       90
1252548excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded                           90
1252656the privilege of monopolizing her that night.  "Anyways,                   90
1252714for an hour]"                                                              90
1252843When I came opposite her house that morning                                90
1252951her white roadster was beside the curb, and she was                        90
1253057sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before.                   90
1253152They were so engrossed in each other that she didn't                       90
1253235see me until I was five feet away.                                         90
1253351"Hello, Jordan,"  she called unexpectedly.  "Please                        90
1253412come here."                                                                90
1253547I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me,                            90
1253651because of all the older girls I admired her most.                         90
1253748She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and                           90
1253848make bandages.  I was.  Well, then, would I tell                           90
1253950them that she couldn't come that day?  The officer                         90
1254044looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a                               90
1254147way that every young girl wants to be looked at                            91
1254248sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I                           91
1254345have remembered the incident ever since.  His                              91
1254449name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn't lay eyes on him                          91
1254549again for over four years--even after I'd met him                          91
1254653on Long Island I didn't realize it was the same man.                       91
1254746That was nineteen-seventeen.  By the next year                             91
1254848I had a few beaux myself, and I began to play in                           91
1254951tournaments, so I didn't see Daisy very often.  She                        91
1255047went with a slightly older crowd--when she went                            91
1255149with anyone at all.  Wild rumors were circulating                          91
1255247about her--how her mother had found her packing                            91
1255346her bag one winter night to go to New York and                             91
1255449say good-by to a soldier who was going overseas.                           91
1255548She was effectually prevented, but she wasn't on                           91
1255650speaking terms with her family for several weeks.                          91
1255751After that she didn't play around with the soldiers                        91
1255856any more, but only with a few flat-footed, short-sighted                   91
1255940young men in town, who couldn't get into                                   91
1256017the army at all.                                                           91
1256144By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as                               91
1256250ever.  She had a debut after the Armistice, and in                         91
1256344February she was presumably engaged to a man                               91
1256442from New Orleans.  In June she married Tom                                 91
1256552Buchanan of Chicago, with more pomp and circumstance                       91
1256637than Louisville ever knew before.  He                                      91
1256747came down with a hundred people in four private                            91
1256852cars, and hired a whole floor of the Seelbach Hotel,                       91
1256951and the day before the wedding he gave her a string                        91
1257052of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand                       92
1257109dollars.                                                                   92
1257244I was bridesmaid.  I came into her room half                               92
1257353an hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying                      92
1257454on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered                     92
1257549dress--and as drunk as a monkey. she had a bottle                          92
1257651of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.                         92
1257745"'gratulate me,"  she muttered.  "Never had a                              92
1257841drink before, but oh how I do enjoy it."                                   92
1257928"What's the matter, Daisy?"                                                92
1258052I was scared, I can tell you;  I'd never seen a girl                       92
1258118like that before.                                                          92
1258253"Here, deares'."  She groped around in a waste-basket                      92
1258342she had with her on the bed and pulled out                                 92
1258448the string of pearls.  "Take 'em down-stairs and                           92
1258550give 'em back to whoever they belong to.  Tell 'em                         92
1258653all Daisy's change' her mine.  Say:  'Daisy's change'                      92
1258712her mine]'"                                                                92
1258848She began to cry--she cried and cried.  I rushed                           92
1258950out and found her mother's maid, and we locked the                         92
1259048door and got her into a cold bath.  She wouldn't                           92
1259152let go of the letter.  She took it into the tub with                       92
1259248her and squeezed it up into a wet ball, and only                           92
1259350let me leave it in the soap-dish when she saw that                         92
1259435it was coming to pieces like snow.                                         92
1259545But she didn't say another word.  We gave her                              92
1259650spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and                         92
1259748hooked her back into her dress, and half an hour                           92
1259849later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls                          92
1259948were around her neck and the incident was over.                            93
1260049Next day at five o'clock she married Tom Buchanan                          93
1260149without so much as a shiver, and started off on a                          93
1260238three months' trip to the South Seas.                                      93
1260342I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came                                 93
1260448back, and I thought I'd never seen a girl so mad                           93
1260552about her husband.  If he left the room for a minute                       93
1260650she'd look around uneasily, and say:  "Where's Tom                         93
1260747gone?"  and wear the most abstracted expression                            93
1260850until she saw him coming in the door.  She used to                         93
1260953sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour,                      93
1261048rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at                           93
1261150him with unfathomable delight.  It was touching to                         93
1261249see them together--it made you laugh in a hushed,                          93
1261350fascinated way.  That was in August.  A week after                         93
1261448I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the                           93
1261548Ventura road one night, and ripped a front wheel                           93
1261652off his car.  The girl who was with him got into the                       93
1261748papers, too, because her arm was broken--she was                           93
1261844one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara                               93
1261907Hotel.                                                                     93
1262050The next April Daisy had her little girl, and they                         93
1262149went to France for a year.  I saw them one spring                          93
1262248in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and then they                           93
1262347came back to Chicago to settle down.  Daisy was                            93
1262444popular in Chicago, as you know.  They moved                               93
1262549with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and                          93
1262649wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect                          93
1262753reputation.  Perhaps because she doesn't drink.  It's                      93
1262850a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking                         94
1262949people.  You can hold your tongue, and, moreover,                          94
1263044you can time any little irregularity of your                               94
1263148own so that everybody else is so blind that they                           94
1263251don't see or care.  Perhaps Daisy never went in for                        94
1263347amour at all--and yet there's something in that                            94
1263421voice of hers. . . .                                                       94
1263545well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name                              94
1263650Gatsby for the first time in years.  It was when I                         94
1263747asked you--do you remember?--if you knew Gatsby                            94
1263846in West Egg.  After you had gone home she came                             94
1263945into my room and woke me up, and said:  "What                              94
1264045Gatsby?" and when I described him--i was half                              94
1264152asleep--she said in the strangest voice that it must                       94
1264250be the man she used to know.  It wasn't until then                         94
1264352that I connected this Gatsby with the officer in her                       94
1264411white car.                                                                 94
1264547When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this                            94
1264647we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were                            94
1264748driving in a victoria through Central Park.  The                           94
1264847sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of                            94
1264950the movie stars in the West Fifties, and the clear                         94
1265050voices of girls, already gathered like crickets on                         94
1265141the grass, rose through the hot twilight:                                  94
1265225"I'm the Sheik of Araby.                                                   94
1265325Your love belongs to me.                                                   94
1265431At night when you're are asleep                                            94
1265530Into your tent I'll creep----"                                             94
1265641"It was a strange coincidence,"  I said.                                   95
1265738"But it wasn't a coincidence at all."                                      95
1265811"Why not?"                                                                 95
1265945"Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would                              95
1266025be just across the bay."                                                   95
1266146Then it had not been merely the stars to which                             95
1266249he had aspired on that June night.  He came alive                          95
1266346to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of his                             95
1266422purposeless splendor.                                                      95
1266550"He wants to know,"  continued Jordan,  "if you'll                         95
1266650invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then                         95
1266720let him come over."                                                        95
1266843The modesty of the demand shook me.  He had                                95
1266947waited five years and bought a mansion where he                            95
1267047dispensed starlight to casual moths--so that he                            95
1267148could "come over" some afternoon to a stranger's                           95
1267208garden.                                                                    95
1267348"Did I have to know all this before he could ask                           95
1267422such a little thing?"                                                      95
1267546"He's afraid, he's waited so long.  He thought                             95
1267653you might be offended.  You see, he's a regular tough                      95
1267720underneath it all."                                                        95
1267822Something worried me.                                                      95
1267946"Why didn't he ask you to arrange a meeting?"                              95
1268049"He wants her to see his house,"  she explained.                           95
1268137"And your house is right next door."                                       95
1268206"Oh]"                                                                      95
1268348"I think he half expected her to wander into one                           95
1268451of his parties, some night,"  went on Jordan,  "but                        95
1268552she never did.  Then he began asking people casually                       96
1268652if they knew her, and I was the first one he found.                        96
1268750It was that night he sent for me at his dance, and                         96
1268849you should have heard the elaborate way he worked                          96
1268947up to it.  Of course, I immediately suggested a                            96
1269048luncheon in New York--and I thought he'd go mad:                           96
1269147"'i don't want to do anything out of the way]'                             96
1269254he kept saying.  'i want to see her right next door.'                      96
1269344"When I said you were a particular friend of                               96
1269448Tom's, he started to abandon the whole idea.  He                           96
1269548doesn't know very much about Tom, though he says                           96
1269647he's read a Chicago paper for years just on the                            96
1269747chance of catching a glimpse of Daisy's name."                             96
1269848It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little                           96
1269951bridge I put my arm around Jordan's golden shoulder                        96
1270048and drew her toward me and asked her to dinner.                            96
1270139Suddenly I wasn't thinking of Daisy and                                    96
1270249Gatsby any more, but of this clean, hard, limited                          96
1270350person, who dealt in universal scepticism, and who                         96
1270449leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my                          96
1270551arm.  A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort                        96
1270650of heady excitement:  "There are only the pursued,                         96
1270739the pursuing, the busy and the tired."                                     96
1270848"And Daisy ought to have something in her life,"                           96
1270923murmured Jordan to me.                                                     96
1271031"Does she want to see Gatsby?"                                             96
1271144"She's not to know about it.  Gatsby doesn't                               96
1271249want her to know.  You're just supposed to invite                          96
1271313her to tea."                                                               96
1271447We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the                            97
1271554facade of Fifty-ninth Street, a block of delicate pale                     97
1271648light, beamed down into the park.  Unlike Gatsby                           97
1271749and Tom Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied                          97
1271849face floated along the dark cornices and blinding                          97
1271954signs, and so I drew up the girl beside me, tightening                     97
1272045my arms.  Her wan, scornful mouth smiled, and                              97
1272153so I drew her up again closer, this time to my face.                       97
1272209CHAPTER V                                                                  98
1272345WHEN I came home to West Egg that night I was                              98
1272447afraid for a moment that my house was on fire.                             98
1272549Two o'clock and the whole corner of the peninsula                          98
1272648was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the                           98
1272750shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the                         98
1272852roadside wires.  Turning a corner, I saw that it was                       98
1272942Gatsby's house, lit from tower to cellar.                                  98
1273052At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout                       98
1273148that had resolved itself into "hide-and-go-seek"                           98
1273250or "sardines-in-the-box" with all the house thrown                         98
1273350open to the game.  But there wasn't a sound.  Only                         98
1273448wind in the trees, which blew the wires and made                           98
1273550the lights go off and on again as if the house had                         98
1273645winked into the darkness.  As my taxi groaned                              98
1273746away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his                             98
1273806lawn.                                                                      98
1273951"Your place looks like the World's Fair,"  I said.                         98
1274051"Does it?"  He turned his eyes toward it absently.                         98
1274152"I have been glancing into some of the rooms.  Let's                       98
1274244go to Coney Island, old sport.  In my car."                                98
1274317"It's too late."                                                           98
1274454"Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming-pool?                      98
1274538I haven't made use of it all summer."                                      98
1274625"I've got to go to bed."                                                   98
1274713"All right."                                                               99
1274852He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.                        99
1274952"I talked with Miss Baker,"  I said after a moment.                        99
1275048"I'm going to call up Daisy to-morrow and invite                           99
1275123her over here to tea."                                                     99
1275254"Oh, that's all right,"  he said carelessly.  "I don't                     99
1275333want to put you to any trouble."                                           99
1275427"What day would suit you?"                                                 99
1275543"What day would suit you?"  he corrected me                                99
1275650quickly.  "I don't want to put you to any trouble,                         99
1275710you see."                                                                  99
1275837"How about the day after to-morrow?"                                       99
1275951He considered for a moment.  Then, with reluctance:                        99
1276041"I want to get the grass cut,"  he said.                                   99
1276140We both looked at the grass--there was a                                   99
1276245sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the                              99
1276352darker, well-kept expanse of his began.  I suspected                       99
1276424that he meant my grass.                                                    99
1276553"There's another little thing,"  he said uncertainly,                      99
1276615and hesitated.                                                             99
1276748"Would you rather put it off for a few days?"  I                           99
1276807asked.                                                                     99
1276951"Oh, it isn't about that.  At least----" He fumbled                        99
1277051with a series of beginnings.  "Why, I thought--why,                        99
1277148look here, old sport, you don't make much money,                           99
1277209do you?"                                                                   99
1277317"Not very much."                                                           99
1277444This seemed to reassure him and he continued                              100
1277518more confidently.                                                         100
1277649"I thought you didn't, if you'll pardon my----You                         100
1277756see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of                  100
1277849side line, you understand.  And I thought that if                         100
1277949you don't make very much----You're selling bonds,                         100
1278024aren't you, old sport?"                                                   100
1278113"Trying to."                                                              100
1278249"Well, this would interest you.  It wouldn't take                         100
1278349up much of your time and you might pick up a nice                         100
1278453bit of money.  It happens to be a rather confidential                     100
1278516sort of thing."                                                           100
1278648I realize now that under different circumstances                          100
1278751that conversation might have been one of the crises                       100
1278849of my life.  But, because the offer was obviously                         100
1278953and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no                     100
1279036choice except to cut him off there.                                       100
1279145"I've got my hands full,"  I said.  "I'm much                             100
1279247obliged but I couldn't take on any more work."                            100
1279342"You wouldn't have to do any business with                                100
1279451Wolfshiem."  Evidently he thought that I was shying                       100
1279539away from the "gonnegtion" mentioned at                                   100
1279649lunch, but I assured him he was wrong.  He waited                         100
1279749a moment longer, hoping I'd begin a conversation,                         100
1279851but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went                       100
1279918unwillingly home.                                                         100
1280047The evening had made me light-headed and happy;                           100
1280150I think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my                        100
1280251front door.  So I didn't know whether or not Gatsby                       100
1280346went to Coney Island, or for how many hours he                            101
1280451"glanced into rooms" while his house blazed gaudily                       101
1280552on.  I called up Daisy from the office next morning,                      101
1280632and invited her to come to tea.                                           101
1280734"Don't bring Tom,"  I warned her.                                         101
1280808"What?"                                                                   101
1280919"Don't bring Tom."                                                        101
1281039"Who is 'Tom'?"  she asked innocently.                                    101
1281148The day agreed upon was pouring rain.  At eleven                          101
1281251o'clock a man in a raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower,                       101
1281348tapped at my front door and said that Mr. Gatsby                          101
1281449had sent him over to cut my grass.  This reminded                         101
1281547me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come                           101
1281652back, so I drove into West Egg Village to search for                      101
1281746her among soggy, whitewashed alleys and to buy                            101
1281834some cups and lemons and flowers.                                         101
1281948The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o'clock                          101
1282052a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby's, with innumerable                      101
1282145receptacles to contain it.  An hour later the                             101
1282245front door opened nervously, and Gatsby, in a                             101
1282355white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-colored tie,                   101
1282451hurried in.  He was pale, and there were dark signs                       101
1282535of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.                                        101
1282650"Is everything all right?"  he asked immediately.                         101
1282749"The grass looks fine, if that's what you mean."                          101
1282845"What grass?"  he inquired blankly.  "Oh, the                             101
1282952grass in the yard."  He looked out the window at it,                      101
1283052but, judging from his expression, I don't believe he                      101
1283113saw a thing.                                                              101
1283246"Looks very good,"  he remarked vaguely.  "One                            102
1283351of the papers said they thought the rain would stop                       102
1283452about four.  I think it was the "Journal."  Have you                      102
1283550got everything you need in the shape of--of tea?"                         102
1283645I took him into the pantry, where he looked a                             102
1283758little reproachfully at the Finn.  Together we scrutinized                102
1283844the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen                              102
1283906shop.                                                                     102
1284026"Will they do?"  I asked.                                                 102
1284146"Of course, of course]  They're fine]"  and he                            102
1284234added hollowly, ". . .old sport."                                         102
1284347The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp                           102
1284451mist, through which occasional thin drops swam like                       102
1284505dew.                                                                      102
1284640Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a                                  102
1284751copy of Clay's "Economics," starting at the Finnish                       102
1284847tread that shook the kitchen floor, and peering                           102
1284947toward the bleared windows from time to time as                           102
1285048if a series of invisible but alarming happenings                          102
1285149were taking place outside.  Finally he got up and                         102
1285247informed me, in an uncertain voice, that he was                           102
1285312going home.                                                               102
1285414"Why's that?"                                                             102
1285545"Nobody's coming to tea.  It's too late]"  He                             102
1285649looked at his watch as if there was some pressing                         102
1285748demand on his time elsewhere.  "I can't wait all                          102
1285806day."                                                                     102
1285949"Don't be silly; it's just two minutes to four."                          102
1286046He sat down miserably, as if I had pushed him,                            102
1286149and simultaneously there was the sound of a motor                         102
1286248turning into my lane.  We both jumped up, and, a                          103
1286350little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.                         103
1286448Under the dripping bare lilac-trees a large open                          103
1286550car was coming up the drive.  It stopped.  Daisy's                        103
1286655face, tipped sideways beneath a three-cornered lavender                   103
1286744hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic                              103
1286807smile.                                                                    103
1286946"Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest                            103
1287006one?"                                                                     103
1287147The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild                           103
1287251tonic in the rain.  I had to follow the sound of it                       103
1287345for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone,                             103
1287448before any words came through.  A damp streak of                          103
1287552hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek,                      103
1287647and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I                           103
1287734took it to help her from the car.                                         103
1287846"Are you in love with me,"  she said low in my                            103
1287941ear,  "or why did I have to come alone?"                                  103
1288049"That's the secret of Castle Rackrent.  Tell your                         103
1288145chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour."                              103
1288248"Come back in an hour, Ferdie."  Then in a grave                          103
1288331murmur:  "His name is Ferdie."                                            103
1288437"Does the gasoline affect his nose?"                                      103
1288550"I don't think so,"  she said innocently.  "Why?"                         103
1288644We went in.  To my overwhelming surprise the                              103
1288726living-room was deserted.                                                 103
1288836"Well, that's funny,"  I exclaimed.                                       103
1288916"What's funny?"                                                           103
1289050She turned her head as there was a light dignified                        103
1289150knocking at the front door.  I went out and opened                        104
1289250it.  Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged                        104
1289351like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a                       104
1289449puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes.                          104
1289551With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked                       104
1289652by me into the hall, turned sharply as if he were on                      104
1289749a wire, and disappeared into the living-room.  It                         104
1289849wasn't a bit funny.  Aware of the loud beating of                         104
1289956my own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing                  104
1290006rain.                                                                     104
1290145For half a minute there wasn't a sound.  Then                             104
1290253from the living-room I heard a sort of choking murmur                     104
1290346and part of a laugh, followed by Daisy's voice                            104
1290427on a clear artificial note:                                               104
1290548"I certainly am awfully glad to see you again."                           104
1290647A pause; it endured horribly.  I had nothing to                           104
1290741do in the hall, so I went into the room.                                  104
1290853Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining                     104
1290949against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit                         104
1291043of perfect ease, even of boredom.  His head                               104
1291153leaned back so far that it rested against the face of                     104
1291251a defunct mantelpiece clock, and from this position                       104
1291349his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy, who was                         104
1291450sitting, frightened but graceful, on the edge of a                        104
1291513stiff chair.                                                              104
1291647"We've met before,"  muttered Gatsby.  His eyes                           104
1291751glanced momentarily at me, and his lips parted with                       104
1291850an abortive attempt at a laugh.  Luckily the clock                        104
1291952took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure                      104
1292043of his head, whereupon he turned and caught                               105
1292153it with trembling fingers, and set it back in place.                      105
1292250Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of                        105
1292335the sofa and his chin in his hand.                                        105
1292439"I'm sorry about the clock,"  he said.                                    105
1292543My own face had now assumed a deep tropical                               105
1292648burn.  I couldn't muster up a single commonplace                          105
1292732out of the thousand in my head.                                           105
1292847"It's an old clock,"  I told them idiotically.                            105
1292948I think we all believed for a moment that it had                          105
1293032smashed in pieces on the floor.                                           105
1293145"We haven't met for many years,"  said Daisy,                             105
1293249her voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be.                          105
1293328"Five years next November."                                               105
1293447The automatic quality of Gatsby's answer set us                           105
1293550all back at least another minute.  I had them both                        105
1293653on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they                     105
1293749help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac                         105
1293830Finn brought it in on a tray.                                             105
1293946Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a                            105
1294052certain physical decency established itself.  Gatsby                      105
1294148got himself into a shadow and, while Daisy and I                          105
1294252talked, looked conscientiously from one to the other                      105
1294353of us with tense, unhappy eyes.  However, as calmness                     105
1294448wasn't an end in itself, I made an excuse at the                          105
1294543first possible moment, and got to my feet.                                105
1294641"Where are you going?" demanded Gatsby in                                 105
1294717immediate alarm.                                                          105
1294816"I'll be back."                                                           105
1294948"I've got to speak to you about something before                          106
1295009you go."                                                                  106
1295146He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed                            106
1295258the door, and whispered:  "Oh, God]"  in a miserable way.                 106
1295321"What's the matter?"                                                      106
1295451"This is a terrible mistake,"  he said, shaking his                       106
1295556head from side to side, "a terrible, terrible mistake."                   106
1295651"You're just embarrassed, that's all,"  and luckily                       106
1295737I added:  "Daisy's embarrassed too."                                      106
1295849"She's embarrassed?"  he repeated incredulously.                          106
1295927"Just as much as you are."                                                106
1296022"Don't talk so loud."                                                     106
1296161"You're acting like a little boy,"  I broke out impatiently.              106
1296241"Not only that, but you're rude.  Daisy's                                 106
1296329sitting in there all alone."                                              106
1296446He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at                            106
1296548me with unforgettable reproach, and, opening the                          106
1296648door cautiously, went back into the other room.                           106
1296745I walked out the back way--just as Gatsby had                             106
1296849when he had made his nervous circuit of the house                         106
1296945half an hour before--and ran for a huge black                             106
1297047knotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric                           106
1297148against the rain.  Once more it was pouring, and                          106
1297252my irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby's gardener,                      106
1297347abounded in small, muddy swamps and prehistoric                           106
1297438marshes.  There was nothing to look at                                    106
1297551from under the tree except Gatsby's enormous house,                       106
1297655so I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for                   106
1297749half an hour.  A brewer had built it early in the                         107
1297848"period" craze, a decade before, and there was a                          107
1297954story that he'd agreed to pay five years' taxes on all                    107
1298049the neighboring cottages if the owners would have                         107
1298155their roofs thatched with straw.  Perhaps their refusal                   107
1298241took the heart out of his plan to Found a                                 107
1298347Family--he went into an immediate decline.  His                           107
1298451children sold his house with the black wreath still                       107
1298551on the door.  Americans, while occasionally willing                       107
1298651to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being                       107
1298711peasantry.                                                                107
1298848After half an hour, the sun shone again, and the                          107
1298947grocer's automobile rounded Gatsby's drive with                           107
1299054the raw material for his servants' dinner--i felt sure                    107
1299149he wouldn't eat a spoonful.  A maid began opening                         107
1299252the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily                      107
1299347in each, and, leaning from a large central bay,                           107
1299442spat meditatively into the garden.  It was                                107
1299550time I went back.  While the rain continued it had                        107
1299650seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and                        107
1299754swelling a little now and then with gusts of emotion.                     107
1299846But in the new silence I felt that silence had                            107
1299929fallen within the house too.                                              107
1300047I went in--after making every possible noise in                           107
1300151the kitchen, short of pushing over the stove--but I                       107
1300252don't believe they heard a sound.  They were sitting                      107
1300352at either end of the couch, looking at each other as                      107
1300451if some question had been asked, or was in the air,                       107
1300545and every vestige of embarrassment was gone.                              107
1300647Daisy's face was smeared with tears, and when I                           108
1300749came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with                         108
1300850her handkerchief before a mirror.  But there was a                        108
1300949change in Gatsby that was simply confounding.  He                         108
1301060literally glowed;  without a word or a gesture of exultation              108
1301138a new well-being radiated from him and                                    108
1301224filled the little room.                                                   108
1301349"Oh, hello, old sport,"  he said, as if he hadn't                         108
1301449seen me for years.  I thought for a moment he was                         108
1301522going to shake hands.                                                     108
1301624"It's stopped raining."                                                   108
1301746"Has it?"  When he realized what I was talking                            108
1301851about, that there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in                       108
1301947the room, he smiled like a weather man, like an                           108
1302052ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the                      108
1302149news to Daisy.  "What do you think of that?  It's                         108
1302218stopped raining."                                                         108
1302354"I'm glad, Jay."  Her throat, full of aching, grieving                    108
1302441beauty, told only of her unexpected joy.                                  108
1302540"I want you and Daisy to come over to my                                  108
1302650house,"  he said,  "I'd like to show her around."                         108
1302735"You're sure you want me to come?"                                        108
1302825"Absolutely, old sport."                                                  108
1302947Daisy went up-stairs to wash her face--too late                           108
1303046I thought with humiliation of my towels--while                            108
1303133Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.                                          108
1303249"My house looks well, doesn't it?"  he demanded.                          108
1303351"See how the whole front of it catches the light."                        108
1303431I agreed that it was splendid.                                            108
1303548"Yes."  His eyes went over it, every arched door                          109
1303650and square tower.  "It took me just three years to                        109
1303732earn the money that bought it."                                           109
1303838"I thought you inherited your money."                                     109
1303949"I did, old sport,"  he said automatically,  "but                         109
1304052I lost most of it in the big panic--the panic of the                      109
1304106war."                                                                     109
1304246I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for                            109
1304353when I asked him what business he was in he answered,                     109
1304444"That's my affair,"  before he realized that                              109
1304533it wasn't the appropriate reply.                                          109
1304648"Oh, I've been in several things,"  he corrected                          109
1304752himself.  "I was in the drug business and then I was                      109
1304854in the oil business.  But I'm not in either one now."                     109
1304945He looked at me with more attention.  "Do you                             109
1305046mean you've been thinking over what I proposed                            109
1305118the other night?"                                                         109
1305244Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the                              109
1305348house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress                          109
1305425gleamed in the sunlight.                                                  109
1305546"That huge place there?"  she cried pointing.                             109
1305618"Do you like it?"                                                         109
1305750"I love it, but I don't see how you live there all                        109
1305808alone."                                                                   109
1305951"I keep it always full of interesting people, night                       109
1306055and day.  People who do interesting things.  Celebrated                   109
1306109people."                                                                  109
1306247Instead of taking the short cut along the Sound                           109
1306344we went down the road and entered by the big                              109
1306447postern.  With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired                           110
1306552this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against                      110
1306651the sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling odor of                       110
1306749jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn and plum                         110
1306856blossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate.                   110
1306944It was strange to reach the marble steps and                              110
1307051find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door,                       110
1307148and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees.                           110
1307251And inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette                       110
1307342music-rooms and Restoration salons, I felt                                110
1307445that there were guests concealed behind every                             110
1307548couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly                          110
1307646silent until we had passed through.  As Gatsby                            110
1307750closed the door of "the Merton College Library"  I                        110
1307847could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break                           110
1307923into ghostly laughter.                                                    110
1308042We went up-stairs, through period bedrooms                                110
1308148swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with                          110
1308250new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms,                        110
1308347and bathrooms with sunken baths--intruding into                           110
1308446one chamber where a dishevelled man in pajamas                            110
1308552was doing liver exercises on the floor.  It was Mr.                       110
1308654Klipspringer, the "boarder."  I had seen him wandering                    110
1308739hungrily about the beach that morning.                                    110
1308852Finally we came to Gatsby's own apartment, a bedroom                      110
1308939and a bath, and an Adam study, where we                                   110
1309048sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he                          110
1309134took from a cupboard in the wall.                                         110
1309245He hadn't once ceased looking at Daisy, and I                             110
1309351think he revalued everything in his house according                       111
1309454to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved                    111
1309546eyes.  Sometimes, too, he stared around at his                            111
1309651possessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual                       111
1309749and astounding presence none of it was any longer                         111
1309846real.  Once he nearly toppled down a flight of                            111
1309908stairs.                                                                   111
1310048His bedroom was the simplest room of all--except                          111
1310152where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of                      111
1310251pure dull gold.  Daisy took the brush with delight,                       111
1310348and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down                          111
1310440and shaded his eyes and began to laugh.                                   111
1310560"It's the funniest thing, old sport,"  he said hilariously.               111
1310630"I can't--  When I try to----"                                            111
1310748He had passed visibly through two states and was                          111
1310851entering upon a third.  After his embarrassment and                       111
1310947his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder                           111
1311049at her presence.  He had been full of the idea so                         111
1311149long, dreamed it right through to the end, waited                         111
1311252with his teeth set, so to speak, at an inconceivable                      111
1311349pitch of intensity.  Now, in the reaction, he was                         111
1311438running down like an overwound clock.                                     111
1311547Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us                           111
1311649two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed                         111
1311750suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and his shirts,                        111
1311842piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.                                 111
1311948"I've got a man in England who buys me clothes.                           111
1312052He sends over a selection of things at the beginning                      111
1312134of each season, spring and fall."                                         111
1312247He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing                           112
1312350them, one by one, before us, shirts of sheer linen                        112
1312455and thick silk and fine flannel, which lost their folds                   112
1312550as they fell and covered the table in many-colored                        112
1312647disarray.  While we admired he brought more and                           112
1312746the soft rich heap mounted higher--shirts with                            112
1312855stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green                   112
1312961and lavender and faint orange, and monograms of Indian blue.              112
1313025Suddenly, with a strained                                                 112
1313152sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began                      112
1313217to cry stormily.                                                          112
1313349"They're such beautiful shirts,"  she sobbed, her                         112
1313451voice muffled in the thick folds.  "It makes me sad                       112
1313551because I've never seen such--such beautiful shirts                       112
1313609before."                                                                  112
1313747After the house, we were to see the grounds and                           112
1313856the swimming-pool, and the hydroplane and the mid-summer                  112
1313939flowers--but outside Gatsby's window it                                   112
1314052began to rain again, so we stood in a row looking at                      112
1314137the corrugated surface of the Sound.                                      112
1314249"If it wasn't for the mist we could see your home                         112
1314350across the bay,"  said Gatsby.  "You always have a                        112
1314451green light that burns all night at the end of your                       112
1314507dock."                                                                    112
1314646Daisy put her arm through his abruptly, but he                            112
1314751seemed absorbed in what he had just said.  Possibly                       112
1314853it had occurred to him that the colossal significance                     112
1314949of that light had now vanished forever.  Compared                         112
1315049to the great distance that had separated him from                         113
1315153Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching                     113
1315245her.  It had seemed as close as a star to the                             113
1315349moon.  Now it was again a green light on a dock.                          113
1315448His count of enchanted objects had diminished by                          113
1315505one.                                                                      113
1315649I began to walk about the room, examining various                         113
1315749indefinite objects in the half darkness.  A large                         113
1315848photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume                          113
1315946attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.                             113
1316014"Who's this?"                                                             113
1316141"That?  That's Mr. Dan Cody, old sport."                                  113
1316235The name sounded faintly familiar.                                        113
1316345"He's dead now.  He used to be my best friend                             113
1316412years ago."                                                               113
1316544There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in                              113
1316648yachting costume, on the bureau--Gatsby with his                          113
1316749head thrown back defiantly--taken apparently when                         113
1316823he was about eighteen.                                                    113
1316949"I adore it,"  exclaimed Daisy.  "The pompadour]                          113
1317043You never told me you had a pompadour--or a                               113
1317108yacht."                                                                   113
1317248"Look at this,"  said Gatsby quickly.  "Here's a                          113
1317330lot of clippings--about you."                                             113
1317450They stood side by side examining it.  I was going                        113
1317549to ask to see the rubies when the phone rang, and                         113
1317629Gatsby took up the receiver.                                              113
1317751"Yes. . . .  well, I can't talk now. . . .  I can't                       113
1317855talk now, old sport. . . .  I said a small town. . . .                    113
1317952he must know what a small town is. . . .  well, he's                      114
1318057no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town...."                  114
1318113He rang off.                                                              114
1318247"Come here quick]"  cried Daisy at the window.                            114
1318348The rain was still falling, but the darkness had                          114
1318451parted in the west, and there was a pink and golden                       114
1318538billow of foamy clouds above the sea.                                     114
1318648"Look at that,"  she whispered, and then after a                          114
1318748moment:  "I'd like to just get one of those pink                          114
1318847clouds and put you in it and push you around."                            114
1318949I tried to go then, but they wouldn't hear of it;                         114
1319062perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone.             114
1319150"I know what we'll do,"  said Gatsby,  "we'll have                        114
1319230Klipspringer play the piano."                                             114
1319345He went out of the room calling "Ewing]"  and                             114
1319456returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed,                  114
1319542slightly worn young man, with shell-rimmed                                114
1319642glasses and scanty blond hair.  He was now                                114
1319754decently clothed in a "sport shirt," open at the neck,                    114
1319847sneakers, and duck trousers of a nebulous hue.                            114
1319944"Did we interrupt your exercises?"  inquired                              114
1320016Daisy politely.                                                           114
1320145"I was asleep,"  cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a                             114
1320252spasm of embarrassment.  "That is, I'd been asleep.                       114
1320322Then I got up. . . ."                                                     114
1320452"klipspringer plays the piano," said Gatsby, cutting                      114
1320541him off.  "Don't you, Ewing, old sport?"                                  114
1320652"I don't play well.  I don't--i hardly play at all.                       114
1320724I'm all out of prac----"                                                  114
1320848"We'll go down-stairs,"  interrupted Gatsby.  He                          115
1320950flipped a switch.  The gray windows disappeared as                        115
1321032the house glowed full of light.                                           115
1321145In the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary                             115
1321253lamp beside the piano.  He lit Daisy's cigarette from                     115
1321351a trembling match, and sat down with her on a couch                       115
1321450far across the room, where there was no light save                        115
1321550what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall.                         115
1321644When Klipspringer had played "The Love Nest"                              115
1321752he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily                      115
1321825for Gatsby in the gloom.                                                  115
1321948"I'm all out of practice, you see.  I told you I                          115
1322040couldn't play.  I'm all out of prac----"                                  115
1322143"Don't talk so much, old sport,"  commanded                               115
1322217Gatsby.  "Play]"                                                          115
1322316"In the morning,                                                          115
1322415In the evening,                                                           115
1322521Ain't we got fun----"                                                     115
1322647Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint                           115
1322753flow of thunder along the Sound.  All the lights were                     115
1322861going on in West Egg now;  the electric trains, men-carrying,             115
1322935were plunging home through the rain                                       115
1323045from New York.  It was the hour of a profound                             115
1323146human change, and excitement was generating on                            115
1323209the air.                                                                  115
1323337"One thing's sure and nothing's surer                                     115
1323448The rich get richer and the poor get--children.                           115
1323516In the meantime,                                                          115
1323620In between time----"                                                      115
1323755As I went over to say good-by I saw that the expression                   116
1323843of bewilderment had come back into Gatsby's                               116
1323945face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to                             116
1324048him as to the quality of his present happiness.                           116
1324148Almost five years]  There must have been moments                          116
1324247even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of                           116
1324350his dreams--not through her own fault, but because                        116
1324454of the colossal vitality of his illusion.  It had gone                    116
1324545beyond her, beyond everything.  He had thrown                             116
1324653himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it                     116
1324754all the time, decking it out with every bright feather                    116
1324853that drifted his way.  No amount of fire or freshness                     116
1324953can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly                     116
1325007heart.                                                                    116
1325146As I watched him he adjusted himself a little,                            116
1325253visibly.  His hand took hold of hers, and as she said                     116
1325350something low in his ear he turned toward her with                        116
1325447a rush of emotion.  I think that voice held him                           116
1325552most, with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because                      116
1325662it couldn't be over-dreamed--that voice was a deathless song.             116
1325743They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up                               116
1325849and held out her hand;  Gatsby didn't know me now                         116
1325951at all.  I looked once more at them and they looked                       116
1326049back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life.                          116
1326147Then I went out of the room and down the marble                           116
1326250steps into the rain, leaving them there together.                         116
1326310CHAPTER VI                                                                117
1326448ABOUT this time an ambitious young reporter from                          117
1326549New York arrived one morning at Gatsby's door and                         117
1326637asked him if he had anything to say.                                      117
1326746"Anything to say about what?"  inquired Gatsby                            117
1326810politely.                                                                 117
1326934"Why--any statement to give out."                                         117
1327048It transpired after a confused five minutes that                          117
1327149the man had heard Gatsby's name around his office                         117
1327250in a connection which he either wouldn't reveal or                        117
1327350didn't fully understand.  This was his day off and                        117
1327454with laudable initiative he had hurried out "to see."                     117
1327553It was a random shot, and yet the reporter's instinct                     117
1327644was right.  Gatsby's notoriety, spread about                              117
1327748by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality                          117
1327852and so become authorities on his past, had increased                      117
1327944all summer until he fell just short of being                              117
1328052news.  Contemporary legends such as the "underground                      117
1328148pipe-line to Canada" attached themselves to him,                          117
1328242and there was one persistent story that he                                117
1328356didn't live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked                  117
1328447like a house and was moved secretly up and down                           117
1328549the Long Island shore.  Just why these inventions                         117
1328652were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North                      117
1328727Dakota, isn't easy to say.                                                117
1328849James Gatz--that was really, or at least legally,                         118
1328952his name.  He had changed it at the age of seventeen                      118
1329055and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning                   118
1329143of his career--when he saw Dan Cody's yacht                               118
1329248drop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake                          118
1329349Superior.  It was James Gatz who had been loafing                         118
1329453along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey                     118
1329550and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay                        118
1329648Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to the                          118
1329746*tuolumne, and informed Cody that a wind might                            118
1329844catch him and break him up in half an hour.                               118
1329950I suppose he'd had the name ready for a long time,                        118
1330055even then.  His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful                   118
1330145farm people--his imagination had never really                             118
1330251accepted them as his parents at all.  The truth was                       118
1330348that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang                          118
1330450from his Platonic conception of himself.  He was a                        118
1330549son of God--a phrase which, if it means anything,                         118
1330650means just that--and he must be about His Father's                        118
1330744business, the service of a vast, vulgar, and                              118
1330850meretricious beauty.  So he invented just the sort                        118
1330949of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would                         118
1331050be likely to invent, and to this conception he was                        118
1331121faithful to the end.                                                      118
1331249For over a year he had been beating his way along                         118
1331349the south shore of Lake Superior as a clam-digger                         118
1331449and a salmon-fisher or in any other capacity that                         118
1331547brought him food and bed.  His brown, hardening                           118
1331655body lived naturally through the half-fierce, half-lazy                   118
1331740work of the bracing days.  He knew women                                  119
1331856early, and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous                  119
1331943of them, of young virgins because they were                               119
1332052ignorant, of the others because they were hysterical                      119
1332154about things which in his overwhelming self-absorbtion                    119
1332221he took for granted.                                                      119
1332349But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot.                          119
1332449The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted                         119
1332559him in his bed at night.  A universe of ineffable gaudiness               119
1332651spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked                       119
1332746on the wash-stand and the moon soaked with wet                            119
1332853light his tangled clothes upon the floor.  Each night                     119
1332955he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness                   119
1333041closed down upon some vivid scene with an                                 119
1333155oblivious embrace.  For a while these reveries provided                   119
1333243an outlet for his imagination;  they were a                               119
1333356satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise                  119
1333450that the rock of the world was founded securely on                        119
1333516a fairy's wing.                                                           119
1333648An instinct toward his future glory had led him,                          119
1333749some months before, to the small Lutheran college                         119
1333851of St. Olaf in southern Minnesota.  He stayed there                       119
1333952two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to                      119
1334058the drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising                119
1334143the janitor's work with which he was to pay                               119
1334246his way through.  Then he drifted back to Lake                            119
1334353Superior, and he was still searching for something to                     119
1334450do on the day that Dan Cody's yacht dropped anchor                        119
1334528in the shallows alongshore.                                               119
1334647Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the                           120
1334753Nevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for                     120
1334854metal since seventy-five.  The transactions in Montana                    120
1334945copper that made him many times a millionaire                             120
1335064found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness,          120
1335140and, suspecting this, an infinite number                                  120
1335247of women tried to separate him from his money.                            120
1335347The none too savory ramifications by which Ella                           120
1335443Kaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de                               120
1335548Maintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in                          120
1335659a yacht, were common knowledge to the turgid sub-journalism               120
1335744of 1902.  He had been coasting along all too                              120
1335850hospitable shores for five years when he turned up                        120
1335947as James Gatz's destiny at Little Girls Point.                            120
1336050To the young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking                        120
1336148up at the railed deck, the yacht represented all                          120
1336250the beauty and glamour in the world.  I suppose he                        120
1336347smiled at Cody--he had probably discovered that                           120
1336445people liked him when he smiled.  At any rate                             120
1336552Cody asked him a few questions (one of them elicited                      120
1336647the brand new name) and found that he was quick                           120
1336749and extravagantly ambitious.  A few days later he                         120
1336850took him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six                        120
1336949pair of white duck trousers, and a yachting cap.                          120
1337051And when the *tuolumne left for the West Indies and                       120
1337135the Barbary Coast Gatsby left too.                                        120
1337251He was employed in a vague personal capacity--while                       120
1337345he remained with Cody he was in turn steward,                             120
1337450mate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor, for Dan                        120
1337543Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody                               121
1337651drunk might soon be about, and he provided for such                       121
1337748contingencies by reposing more and more trust in                          121
1337850Gatsby.  The arrangement lasted five years, during                        121
1337954which the boat went three times around the Continent.                     121
1338044It might have lasted indefinitely except for                              121
1338150the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night in                        121
1338245Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably                             121
1338306died.                                                                     121
1338445I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby's                             121
1338556bedroom, a gray, florid man with a hard, empty face--the                  121
1338642pioneer debauchee, who during one phase of                                121
1338750American life brought back to the Eastern seaboard                        121
1338856the savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon.                   121
1338950It was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so                        121
1339053little.  Sometimes in the course of gay parties women                     121
1339151used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he                       121
1339242formed the habit of letting liquor alone.                                 121
1339347And it was from Cody that he inherited money--a                           121
1339450legacy of twenty-five thousand dollars.  He didn't                        121
1339550get it.  He never understood the legal device that                        121
1339646was used against him, but what remained of the                            121
1339752millions went intact to Ella Kaye.  He was left with                      121
1339856his singularly appropriate education;  the vague contour                  121
1339950of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substantiality                        121
1340010of a man.                                                                 121
1340149He told me all this very much later, but I've put                         121
1340251it down here with the idea of exploding those first                       121
1340348wild rumors about his antecedents, which weren't                          122
1340450even faintly true.  Moreover he told it to me at a                        122
1340550time of confusion, when I had reached the point of                        122
1340649believing everything and nothing about him.  So I                         122
1340751take advantage of this short halt, while Gatsby, so                       122
1340871to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions away.    122
1340956It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs.                   122
1341052For several weeks I didn't see him or hear his voice                      122
1341148on the phone--mostly I was in New York, trotting                          122
1341250around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself                        122
1341352with her senile aunt--but finally I went over to his                      122
1341448house one Sunday afternoon.  I hadn't been there                          122
1341546two minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan                            122
1341651in for a drink.  I was startled, naturally, but the                       122
1341751really surprising thing was that it hadn't happened                       122
1341808before.                                                                   122
1341944They were a party of three on horseback--Tom                              122
1342046and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a                            122
1342151brown riding-habit, who had been there previously.                        122
1342250"I'm delighted to see you,"  said Gatsby, standing                        122
1342352on his porch.  "I'm delighted that you dropped in."                       122
1342422As though they cared]                                                     122
1342548"Sit right down.  Have a cigarette or a cigar."                           122
1342650He walked around the room quickly, ringing bells.                         122
1342747"I'll have something to drink for you in just a                           122
1342809minute."                                                                  122
1342947He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom                           122
1343050was there.  But he would be uneasy anyhow until he                        122
1343150had given them something, realizing in a vague way                        123
1343251that that was all they came for.  Mr. Sloane wanted                       123
1343356nothing.  A lemonade?  No, thanks.  A little champagne?                   123
1343444Nothing at all, thanks. . . .  I'm sorry----                              123
1343528"Did you have a nice ride?"                                               123
1343631"Very good roads around here."                                            123
1343731"I suppose the automobiles----"                                           123
1343808"Yeah."                                                                   123
1343947Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned                           123
1344046to Tom, who had accepted the introduction as a                            123
1344110stranger.                                                                 123
1344243"I believe we've met somewhere before, Mr.                                123
1344311Buchanan."                                                                123
1344451"Oh, yes,"  said Tom, gruffly polite, but obviously                       123
1344546not remembering.  "So we did.  I remember very                            123
1344607well."                                                                    123
1344723"About two weeks ago."                                                    123
1344842"That's right.  You were with Nick here."                                 123
1344945"I know your wife,"  continued Gatsby, almost                             123
1345014aggressively.                                                             123
1345111"That so?"                                                                123
1345218Tom turned to me.                                                         123
1345328"You live near here, Nick?"                                               123
1345413"Next door."                                                              123
1345511"That so?"                                                                123
1345646Mr. Sloane didn't enter into the conversation,                            123
1345751but lounged back haughtily in his chair;  the woman                       123
1345850said nothing either--until unexpectedly, after two                        123
1345931highballs, she became cordial.                                            123
1346045"We'll all come over to your next party, Mr.                              124
1346145Gatsby,"  she suggested.  "What do you say?"                              124
1346243"Certainly; I'd be delighted to have you."                                124
1346353"Be ver' nice,"  said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude.                      124
1346441"Well--think ought to be starting home."                                  124
1346549"Please don't hurry,"  Gatsby urged them.  He had                         124
1346652control of himself now, and he wanted to see more of                      124
1346744Tom.  "Why don't you--why don't you stay for                              124
1346853supper?  I wouldn't be surprised if some other people                     124
1346927dropped in from New York."                                                124
1347044"You come to supper with me,"  said the lady                              124
1347134enthusiastically.  "Both of you."                                         124
1347247This included me.  Mr. Sloane got to his feet.                            124
1347341"Come along,"  he said--but to her only.                                  124
1347452"I mean it,"  she insisted.  "I'd love to have you.                       124
1347515Lots of room."                                                            124
1347645Gatsby looked at me questioningly.  He wanted                             124
1347755to go, and he didn't see that Mr. Sloane had determined                   124
1347814he shouldn't.                                                             124
1347942"I'm afraid I won't be able to,"  I said.                                 124
1348046"Well, you come,"  she urged, concentrating on                            124
1348108Gatsby.                                                                   124
1348248Mr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.                           124
1348349"We won't be late if we start now,"  she insisted                         124
1348407aloud.                                                                    124
1348550"I haven't got a horse,"  said Gatsby.  "I used to                        124
1348649ride in the army, but I've never bought a horse.                          124
1348749I'll have to follow you in my car.  Excuse me for                         124
1348816just a minute."                                                           124
1348945The rest of us walked out on the porch, where                             125
1349061Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside.              125
1349149"My God, I believe the man's coming,"  said Tom.                          125
1349240"Doesn't he know she doesn't want him?"                                   125
1349330"She says she does want him."                                             125
1349445"She has a big dinner party and he won't know                             125
1349551a soul there."  He frowned.  "I wonder where in the                       125
1349651devil he met Daisy.  By God, I may be old-fashioned                       125
1349748in my ideas, but women run around too much these                          125
1349854days to suit me.  They meet all kinds of crazy fish."                     125
1349944Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down                              125
1350036the steps and mounted their horses.                                       125
1350150"Come on,"  said Mr. Sloane to Tom,  "we're late.                         125
1350248We've got to go."  And then to me:  "Tell him we                          125
1350326couldn't wait, will you?"                                                 125
1350447Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged                           125
1350552a cool nod, and they trotted quickly down the drive,                      125
1350653disappearing under the August foliage just as Gatsby,                     125
1350749with hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the                         125
1350812front door.                                                               125
1350946Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy's running                            125
1351052around alone, for on the following Saturday night he                      125
1351154came with her to Gatsby's party.  Perhaps his presence                    125
1351259gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness--it               125
1351337stands out in my memory from Gatsby's                                     125
1351447other parties that summer.  There were the same                           125
1351553people, or at least the same sort of people, the same                     125
1351646profusion of champagne, the same many-colored,                            125
1351750many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness                        126
1351845in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn't                             126
1351949been there before.  Or perhaps I had merely grown                         126
1352056used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete                  126
1352145in itself, with its own standards and its own                             126
1352250great figures, second to nothing because it had no                        126
1352351consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at                       126
1352459it again, through Daisy's eyes.  It is invariably saddening               126
1352545to look through new eyes at things upon which                             126
1352649you have expended your own powers of adjustment.                          126
1352749They arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out                         126
1352847among the sparkling hundreds, Daisy's voice was                           126
1352940playing murmurous tricks in her throat.                                   126
1353049"These things excite me so,"  she whispered.  "If                         126
1353148you want to kiss me any time during the evening,                          126
1353253Nick, just let me know and I'll be glad to arrange it                     126
1353351for you.  Just mention my name.  Or present a green                       126
1353432card.  I'm giving out green----"                                          126
1353534"Look around,"  suggested Gatsby.                                         126
1353649"I'm looking around.  I'm having a marvelous----"                         126
1353745"You must see the faces of many people you've                             126
1353814heard about."                                                             126
1353938Tom's arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.                                     126
1354046"We don't go around very much,"  he said.  "In                            126
1354153fact, I was just thinking I don't know a soul here."                      126
1354247"Perhaps you know that lady."  Gatsby indicated                           126
1354348a gorgeous, scarcely human orchid of a woman who                          126
1354452sat in state under a white plum tree.  Tom and Daisy                      126
1354560stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies              127
1354647the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity                           127
1354715of the movies.                                                            127
1354829"She's lovely,"  said Daisy.                                              127
1354944"The man bending over her is her director."                               127
1355047He took them ceremoniously from group to group:                           127
1355140"Mrs. Buchanan . . . and Mr. Buchanan--"                                  127
1355250After an instant's hesitation he added:  "the polo                        127
1355309player."                                                                  127
1355443"Oh no,"  objected Tom quickly,  "not me."                                127
1355549But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby, for                         127
1355650Tom remained "the polo player" for the rest of the                        127
1355709evening.                                                                  127
1355856"I've never met so many celebrities]"  Daisy exclaimed.                   127
1355939"I liked that man--what was his name?--                                   127
1356029with the sort of blue nose."                                              127
1356149Gatsby identified him, adding that he was a small                         127
1356210producer.                                                                 127
1356328"Well, I liked him anyhow."                                               127
1356451"I'd a little rather not be the polo player,"  said                       127
1356553Tom pleasantly,  "I'd rather look at all these famous                     127
1356625people in--in oblivion."                                                  127
1356742Daisy and Gatsby danced.  I remember being                                127
1356851surprised by his graceful, conservative fox-trot--i                       127
1356953had never seen him dance before.  Then they sauntered                     127
1357046over to my house and sat on the steps for half                            127
1357151an hour, while at her request I remained watchfully                       127
1357257in the garden.  "In case there's a fire or a flood,"  she                 127
1357333explained,  "or any act of God."                                          127
1357449Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting                         128
1357546down to supper together. "do you mind if I eat                            128
1357651with some people over here?"  he said.  "A fellow's                       128
1357731getting off some funny stuff."                                            128
1357850"Go ahead,"  answered Daisy genially,  "and if you                        128
1357948want to take down any addresses here's my little                          128
1358052gold pencil." . . . she looked around after a moment                      128
1358145and told me the girl was "common but pretty,"                             128
1358251and I knew that except for the half-hour she'd been                       128
1358349alone with Gatsby she wasn't having a good time.                          128
1358448We were at a particularly tipsy table.  That was                          128
1358550my fault--Gatsby had been called to the phone, and                        128
1358653I'd enjoyed these same people only two weeks before.                      128
1358748But what had amused me then turned septic on the                          128
1358809air now.                                                                  128
1358934"How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?"                                         128
1359049The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to                         128
1359151slump against my shoulder.  At this inquiry she sat                       128
1359224up and opened her eyes.                                                   128
1359308"Wha'?"                                                                   128
1359443A massive and lethargic woman, who had been                               128
1359552urging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club                      128
1359644to-morrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker's defence:                              128
1359749"Oh, she's all right now.  When she's had five or                         128
1359853six cocktails she always starts screaming like that.                      128
1359941I tell her she ought to leave it alone."                                  128
1360055"I do leave it alone,"  affirmed the accused hollowly.                    128
1360145"We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet                             128
1360246here:  'There's somebody that needs your help,                            129
1360307Doc.'"                                                                    129
1360445"She's much obliged, I'm sure,"  said another                             129
1360550friend, without gratitude.  "But you got her dress                        129
1360646all wet when you stuck her head in the pool."                             129
1360745"Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a                             129
1360844pool,"  mumbled Miss Baedeker.  "They almost                              129
1360937drowned me once over in New Jersey."                                      129
1361046"Then you ought to leave it alone,"  countered                            129
1361114Doctor Civet.                                                             129
1361254"Speak for yourself]"  cried Miss Baedeker violently.                     129
1361338"Your hand shakes.  I wouldn't let you                                    129
1361416operate on me]"                                                           129
1361551It was like that.  Almost the last thing I remember                       129
1361655was standing with Daisy and watching the moving-picture                   129
1361745director and his Star.  They were still under                             129
1361849the white plum tree and their faces were touching                         129
1361950except for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between.                         129
1362054It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending                    129
1362148toward her all evening to attain this proximity,                          129
1362253and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate                     129
1362330degree and kiss at her cheek.                                             129
1362452"I like her,"  said Daisy,  "I think she's lovely."                       129
1362550But the rest offended her--and inarguably, because                        129
1362644it wasn't a gesture but an emotion.  She was                              129
1362748appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented "place"                          129
1362845that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island                             129
1362954fishing village--appalled by its raw vigor that chafed                    129
1363049under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive                         129
1363150fate that herded its inhabitants along a short-cut                        130
1363249from nothing to nothing.  She saw something awful                         130
1363349in the very simplicity she failed to understand.                          130
1363445I sat on the front steps with them while they                             130
1363555waited for their car.  It was dark here in front;  only                   130
1363655the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying                   130
1363745out into the soft black morning.  Sometimes a                             130
1363849shadow moved against a dressing-room blind above,                         130
1363955gave way to another shadow, an indefinite procession of                   130
1364038shadows, who rouged and powdered in an                                    130
1364117invisible glass.                                                          130
1364242"Who is this Gatsby anyhow?"  demanded Tom                                130
1364334suddenly.  "Some big bootlegger?"                                         130
1364438"Where'd you hear that?"  I inquired.                                     130
1364550"I didn't hear it.  I imagined it.  A lot of these                        130
1364647newly rich people are just big bootleggers, you                           130
1364707know."                                                                    130
1364831"Not Gatsby,"  I said shortly.                                            130
1364947He was silent for a moment.  The pebbles of the                           130
1365031drive crunched under his feet.                                            130
1365149"Well, he certainly must have strained himself to                         130
1365230get this menagerie together."                                             130
1365354A breeze stirred the gray haze of Daisy's fur collar.                     130
1365443"At least they're more interesting than the                               130
1365543people we know,"  she said with an effort.                                130
1365633"You didn't look so interested."                                          130
1365715"Well, I was."                                                            130
1365830Tom laughed and turned to me.                                             130
1365949"Did you notice Daisy's face when that girl asked                         131
1366037her to put her under a cold shower?"                                      131
1366146Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky,                            131
1366247rythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each                           131
1366349word that it had never had before and would never                         131
1366450have again.  When the melody rose, her voice broke                        131
1366551up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices                       131
1366653have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm                     131
1366726human magic upon the air.                                                 131
1366847"Lots of people come who haven't been invited,"                           131
1366952she said suddenly.  "That girl hadn't been invited.                       131
1367050They simply force their way in and he's too polite                        131
1367112to object."                                                               131
1367246"I'd like to know who he is and what he does,"                            131
1367363insisted Tom.  "And I think I'll make a point of finding out."            131
1367447"I can tell you right now,"  she answered.  "He                           131
1367549owned some drug-stores, a lot of drug-stores.  He                         131
1367624built them up himself."                                                   131
1367750The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.                         131
1367833"Good night, Nick,"  said Daisy.                                          131
1367948Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of                          131
1368048the steps, where "Three o'Clock in the Morning,"                          131
1368155a neat, sad little waltz of that year, was drifting out                   131
1368252the open door.  After all, in the very casualness of                      131
1368348Gatsby's party there were romantic possibilities                          131
1368452totally absent from her world.  What was it up there                      131
1368555in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside?                    131
1368646What would happen now in the dim, incalculable                            131
1368745hours?  Perhaps some unbelievable guest would                             132
1368852arrive, a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled                      132
1368950at, some authentically radiant young girl who with                        132
1369049one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical                         132
1369167encounter, would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion.        132
1369249I stayed late that night, Gatsby asked me to wait                         132
1369353until he was free, and I lingered in the garden until                     132
1369449the inevitable swimming party had run up, chilled                         132
1369551and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights                       132
1369647were extinguished in the guest-rooms overhead.                            132
1369751When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin                       132
1369851was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes                       132
1369923were bright and tired.                                                    132
1370044"She didn't like it,"  he said immediately.                               132
1370121"Of course she did."                                                      132
1370253"She didn't like it,"  he insisted.  "She didn't have                     132
1370314a good time."                                                             132
1370447He was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable                           132
1370512depression.                                                               132
1370652"I feel far away from her,"  he said.  "It's hard to                      132
1370722make her understand."                                                     132
1370828"You mean about the dance?"                                               132
1370948"The dance?"  He dismissed all the dances he had                          132
1371056given with a snap of his fingers.  "Old sport, the dance                  132
1371117is unimportant."                                                          132
1371245He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she                             132
1371348should go to Tom and say:  "I never loved you."                           132
1371455After she had obliterated four years with that sentence                   132
1371541they could decide upon the more practical                                 132
1371650measures to be taken.  One of them was that, after                        133
1371752she was free, they were to go back to Louisville and                      133
1371850be married from her house--just as if it were five                        133
1371911years ago.                                                                133
1372050"And she doesn't understand,"  he said.  "She used                        133
1372150to be able to understand.  We'd sit for hours----"                        133
1372244He broke off and began to walk up and down a                              133
1372353desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favors and                     133
1372417crushed flowers.                                                          133
1372547"I wouldn't ask too much of her,"  I ventured.                            133
1372629"You can't repeat the past."                                              133
1372750"Can't repeat the past?"  he cried incredulously.                         133
1372825"Why of course you can]"                                                  133
1372948He looked around him wildly, as if the past were                          133
1373052lurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of                      133
1373119reach of his hand.                                                        133
1373248"I'm going to fix everything just the way it was                          133
1373356before,"  he said, nodding determinedly.  "She'll see."                   133
1373451He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that                       133
1373552he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself                      133
1373646perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy.  His                            133
1373749life had been confused and disordered since then,                         133
1373849but if he could once return to a certain starting                         133
1373950place and go over it all slowly, he could find out                        133
1374027what that thing was. . . .                                                133
1374148 . . . one autumn night, five years before, they                          133
1374248had been walking down the street when the leaves                          133
1374350were falling, and they came to a place where there                        133
1374457were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight.                  133
1374540They stopped here and turned toward each                                  133
1374652other.  Now it was a cool night with that mysterious                      134
1374750excitement in it which comes at the two changes of                        134
1374854the year.  The quiet lights in the houses were humming                    134
1374946out into the darkness and there was a stir and                            134
1375053bustle among the stars.  Out of the corner of his eye                     134
1375150Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really                        134
1375251formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above                       134
1375353the trees--he could climb to it, if hs climbed alone,                     134
1375453and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp                     134
1375538down the incomparable milk of wonder.                                     134
1375649His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's white                         134
1375746face came up to his own.  He knew that when he                            134
1375857kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions                 134
1375946to her perishable breath, his mind would never                            134
1376047romp again like the mind of God.  So he waited,                           134
1376148listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork                          134
1376249that had been struck upon a star.  Then he kissed                         134
1376351her.  At his lips' touch she blossomed for him like                       134
1376443a flower and the incarnation was complete.                                134
1376547Through all he said, even through his appalling                           134
1376647sentimentality, I was reminded of something--an                           134
1376752elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had                      134
1376848heard somewhere a long time ago.  For a moment a                          134
1376950phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips                        134
1377050parted like a dumb man's, as though there was more                        134
1377150struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air.                         134
1377245But they made no sound, and what I had almost                             134
1377339remembered was uncommunicable forever.                                    134
1377411CHAPTER VII                                                               135
1377545IT was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its                             135
1377656highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one                  135
1377750Saturday night--and, as obscurely as it had begun,                        135
1377850his career as Trimalchio was over.  Only gradually                        135
1377945did I become aware that the automobiles which                             135
1378049turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just                         135
1378148a minute and then drove sulkily away.  Wondering                          135
1378254if he were sick I went over to find out--an unfamiliar                    135
1378344butler with a villainous face squinted at me                              135
1378428suspiciously from the door.                                               135
1378522"Is Mr. Gatsby sick?"                                                     135
1378652"Nope."  After a pause he added "sir" in a dilatory,                      135
1378714grudging way.                                                             135
1378853"I hadn't seen him around, and I was rather worried.                      135
1378934Tell him Mr. Carraway came over."                                         135
1379028"Who?"  he demanded rudely.                                               135
1379112"Carraway."                                                               135
1379239"Carraway.  All right, I'll tell him."                                    135
1379330Abruptly he slammed the door.                                             135
1379445My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed                             135
1379550every servant in his house a week ago and replaced                        135
1379650them with half a dozen others, who never went into                        135
1379747West Egg Village to be bribed by the tradesmen,                           135
1379850but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone.                         135
1379948The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked                          135
1380053like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village                     136
1380149was that the new people weren't servants at all.                          136
1380240Next day Gatsby called me on the phone.                                   136
1380327"Going away?"  I inquired.                                                136
1380417"No, old sport."                                                          136
1380538"I hear you fired all your servants."                                     136
1380646"I wanted somebody who wouldn't gossip.  Daisy                            136
1380744comes over quite often--in the afternoons."                               136
1380850So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card                        136
1380938house at the disapproval in her eyes.                                     136
1381043"They're some people Wolfshiem wanted to do                               136
1381150something for.  They're all brothers and sisters.                         136
1381233They used to run a small hotel."                                          136
1381309"I see."                                                                  136
1381445He was calling up at Daisy's request--would I                             136
1381549come to lunch at her house to-morrow?  Miss Baker                         136
1381649would be there.  Half an hour later Daisy herself                         136
1381749telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was                         136
1381854coming.  Something was up.  And yet I couldn't believe                    136
1381942that they would choose this occasion for a                                136
1382048scene--especially for the rather harrowing scene                          136
1382140that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.                                   136
1382253The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly                     136
1382340the warmest, of the summer.  As my train                                  136
1382451emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot                       136
1382550whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the                        136
1382651simmering hush at noon.  The straw seats of the car                       136
1382750hovered on the edge of combustion;  the woman next                        136
1382853to me perspired delicately for a while into her white                     136
1382947shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened                           137
1383053under her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat                     137
1383152with a desolate cry.  Her pocket-book slapped to the                      137
1383207floor.                                                                    137
1383323"Oh, my]"  she gasped.                                                    137
1383446I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it                            137
1383550back to her, holding it at arm's length and by the                        137
1383652extreme tip of the corners to indicate that I had no                      137
1383749designs upon it--but every one near by, including                         137
1383839the woman, suspected me just the same.                                    137
1383946"Hot]"  said the conductor to familiar faces.                             137
1384042"Some weather]... hot]... hot]... hot]...                                 137
1384150Is it hot enough for you?  Is it hot?  Is it...?"                         137
1384244My commutation ticket came back to me with a                              137
1384351dark stain from his hand.  That any one should care                       137
1384453in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed, whose head                     137
1384544made damp the pajama pocket over his heart]                               137
1384647 . . . Through the hall of the Buchanans' house                           137
1384754blew a faint wind, carrying the sound of the telephone                    137
1384841bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at                                 137
1384910the door.                                                                 137
1385048"The master's body]"  roared the butler into the                          137
1385145mouthpiece.  "I'm sorry, madame, but we can't                             137
1385250furnish it--it's far too hot to touch this noon]"                         137
1385346What he really said was: "Yes ... yes ... I'll                            137
1385406see."                                                                     137
1385544He set down the receiver and came toward us,                              137
1385651glistening slightly, to take our stiff straw hats.                        137
1385745"Madame expects you in the salon]"  he cried,                             137
1385850needlessly indicating the direction.  In this heat                        138
1385948every extra gesture was an affront to the common                          138
1386015store of life.                                                            138
1386146The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark                            138
1386248and cool.  Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous                          138
1386348couch, like silver idols weighing down their own                          138
1386454white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.                     138
1386538"We can't move,"  they said together.                                     138
1386648Jordan's fingers, powdered white over their tan,                          138
1386729rested for a moment in mine.                                              138
1386842"And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?"  I                                138
1386910inquired.                                                                 138
1387049Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled,                         138
1387130husky, at the hall telephone.                                             138
1387248Gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet                          138
1387345and gazed around with fascinated eyes.  Daisy                             138
1387451watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh;                       138
1387550a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the                        138
1387605air.                                                                      138
1387748"The rumor is,"  whispered Jordan,  "that that's                          138
1387830Tom's girl on the telephone."                                             138
1387948We were silent.  The voice in the hall rose high                          138
1388051with annoyance:  "Very well, then, I won't sell you                       138
1388154the car at all. . . .  I'm under no obligations to you                    138
1388253at all . . . and as for your bothering me about it at                     138
1388340lunch time, I won't stand that at all]"                                   138
1388452"Holding down the receiver,"  said Daisy cynically.                       138
1388550"No, he's not,"  I assured her.  "It's a bona-fide                        138
1388635deal.  I happen to know about it."                                        138
1388746Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space                            139
1388850for a moment with his thick body, and hurried into                        139
1388910the room.                                                                 139
1389046"Mr. Gatsby]"  He put out his broad, flat hand                            139
1389151with well-concealed dislike.  "I'm glad to see you,                       139
1389225sir. . . .  nick. . . ."                                                  139
1389338"make us a cold drink,"  cried Daisy.                                     139
1389450As he left the room again she got up and went over                        139
1389550to Gatsby and pulled his face down, kissing him on                        139
1389611the mouth.                                                                139
1389738"You know I love you,"  she murmured.                                     139
1389851"You forget there's a lady present,"  said Jordan.                        139
1389932Daisy looked around doubtfully.                                           139
1390021"You kiss Nick too."                                                      139
1390127"What a low, vulgar girl]"                                                139
1390247"I don't care]"  cried Daisy, and began to clog                           139
1390348on the brick fireplace.  Then she remembered the                          139
1390449heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a                         139
1390550freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came                        139
1390615into the room.                                                            139
1390746"Bles-sed pre-cious," she crooned, holding out                            139
1390846her arms.  "Come to your own mother that loves                            139
1390906you."                                                                     139
1391051The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across                       139
1391151the room and rooted shyly into her mother's dress.                        139
1391247"The bles-sed pre-cious]  Did mother get powder                           139
1391344on your old yellowy hair?  Stand up now, and                              139
1391417say--How-de-do."                                                          139
1391545Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the                             139
1391649small, reluctant hand.  Afterward he kept looking                         140
1391754at the child with surprise.  I don't think he had ever                    140
1391841really believed in its existence before.                                  140
1391949"I got dressed before luncheon,"  said the child,                         140
1392026turning eagerly to Daisy.                                                 140
1392142"That's because your mother wanted to show                                140
1392251you off."  Her face bent into the single wrinkle of                       140
1392354the small, white neck.  "You dream, you.  You absolute                    140
1392415little dream."                                                            140
1392549"Yes," admitted the child calmly.  "Aunt Jordan's                         140
1392627got on a white dress too."                                                140
1392742"How do you like mother's friends?"  Daisy                                140
1392848turned her around so that she faced Gatsby.  "Do                          140
1392927you think they're pretty?"                                                140
1393017"Where's Daddy?"                                                          140
1393146"She doesn't look like her father,"  explained                            140
1393250Daisy.  "She looks like me.  She's got my hair and                        140
1393320shape of the face."                                                       140
1393446Daisy sat back upon the couch.  The nurse took                            140
1393538a step forward and held out her hand.                                     140
1393615"Come, Pammy."                                                            140
1393723"Good-by, sweetheart]"                                                    140
1393853With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined                     140
1393945child held to her nurse's hand and was pulled                             140
1394051out the door, just as Tom came back, preceding four                       140
1394138gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.                                     140
1394226Gatsby took up his drink.                                                 140
1394350"They certainly look cool,"  he said, with visible                        140
1394409tension.                                                                  140
1394535We drank in long, greedy swallows.                                        141
1394647"I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter                           141
1394748every year,"  said Tom genially.  "It seems that                          141
1394854pretty soon the earth's going to fall into the sun--or                    141
1394948wait a minute--it's just the opposite--the sun's                          141
1395027getting colder every year.                                                141
1395146"Come outside,"  he suggested to Gatsby,  "I'd                            141
1395239like you to have a look at the place."                                    141
1395344I went with them out to the veranda.  On the                              141
1395449green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail                         141
1395548crawled slowly toward the fresher sea.  Gatsby's                          141
1395653eyes followed it momentarily;  he raised his hand and                     141
1395724pointed across the bay.                                                   141
1395829"I'm right across from you."                                              141
1395914"So you are."                                                             141
1396046Our eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot                            141
1396155lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog-days along-shore.                    141
1396240Slowly the white wings of the boat moved                                  141
1396350against the blue cool limit of the sky.  Ahead lay                        141
1396453the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles.                      141
1396545"There's sport for you,"  said Tom, nodding.                              141
1396647"I'd like to be out there with him for about an                           141
1396707hour."                                                                    141
1396844We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened                              141
1396944too against the heat, and drank down nervous                              141
1397026gayety with the cold ale.                                                 141
1397147"What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon?"                            141
1397251cried Daisy,  "and the day after that, and the next                       141
1397315thirty years?"                                                            141
1397450"Don't be morbid,"  Jordan said.  "Life starts all                        142
1397544over again when it gets crisp in the fall."                               142
1397651"But it's so hot,"  insisted Daisy, on the verge of                       142
1397752tears,  "and everything's so confused.  Let's all go                      142
1397810to town]"                                                                 142
1397948Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating                          142
1398050against it, molding its senselessness into forms.                         142
1398148"I've heard of making a garage out of a stable,"                          142
1398249Tom was saying to Gatsby,  "but I'm the first man                         142
1398341who ever made a stable out of a garage."                                  142
1398442"Who wants to go to town?"  demanded Daisy                                142
1398554insistently.  Gatsby's eyes floated toward her.  "Ah,"                    142
1398632she cried,  "you look so cool."                                           142
1398748Their eyes met, and they stared together at each                          142
1398850other, alone in space.  With an effort she glanced                        142
1398919down at the table.                                                        142
1399042"You always look so cool,"  she repeated.                                 142
1399140She had told him that she loved him, and                                  142
1399247Tom Buchanan saw.  He was astounded.  His mouth                           142
1399350opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and then                        142
1399449back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as                         142
1399534some one he knew a long time ago.                                         142
1399644"You resemble the advertisement of the man,"                              142
1399752she went on innocently.  "You know the advertisement                      142
1399815of the man----"                                                           142
1399951"All right,"  broke in Tom quickly,  "I'm perfectly                       142
1400051willing to go to town.  Come on--we're all going to                       142
1400107town."                                                                    142
1400249He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby                         142
1400329and his wife.  No one moved.                                              142
1400449"Come on]"  His temper cracked a little.  "What's                         143
1400550the matter, anyhow?  If we're going to town, let's                        143
1400608start."                                                                   143
1400752His hand, trembling with his effort at self-control,                      143
1400855bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale.  Daisy's                   143
1400950voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing                        143
1401014gravel drive.                                                             143
1401148"Are we just going to go?"  she objected.  "Like                          143
1401245this?  Aren't we going to let any one smoke a                             143
1401318cigarette first?"                                                         143
1401438"Everybody smoked all through lunch."                                     143
1401549"Oh, let's have fun,"  she begged him.  "It's too                         143
1401614hot to fuss."                                                             143
1401718He didn't answer.                                                         143
1401845"Have it your own way,"  she said.  "Come on,                             143
1401909Jordan."                                                                  143
1402047They went up-stairs to get ready while we three                           143
1402150men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our                        143
1402252feet.  A silver curve of the moon hovered already in                      143
1402350the western sky.  Gatsby started to speak, changed                        143
1402450his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him                        143
1402513expectantly.                                                              143
1402647"Have you got your stables here?"  asked Gatsby                           143
1402716with an effort.                                                           143
1402843"About a quarter of a mile down the road."                                143
1402906"Oh."                                                                     143
1403009A pause.                                                                  143
1403151"I don't see the idea of going to town,"  broke out                       143
1403248Tom savagely.  "Women get these notions in their                          143
1403310heads----"                                                                143
1403448"Shall we take anything to drink?"  called Daisy                          144
1403522from an upper window.                                                     144
1403648"I'll get some whiskey,"  answered Tom.  He went                          144
1403708inside.                                                                   144
1403828Gatsby turned to me rigidly:                                              144
1403948"I can't say anything in his house, old sport."                           144
1404052"She's got an indiscreet voice,"  I remarked.  "It's                      144
1404125full of--"  I hesitated.                                                  144
1404249"Her voice is full of money,"  he said suddenly.                          144
1404350That was it.  I'd never understood before.  It was                        144
1404447full of money--that was the inexhaustible charm                           144
1404556that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals'                  144
1404651song of it. . . . high in a white palace the king's                       144
1404733daughter, the golden girl. . . .                                          144
1404842tom came out of the house wrapping a quart                                144
1404947bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan                           144
1405055wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying                   144
1405129light capes over their arms.                                              144
1405248"Shall we all go in my car?"  suggested Gatsby.                           144
1405353He felt the hot, green leather of the seat.  "I ought                     144
1405431to have left it in the shade."                                            144
1405539"Is it standard shift?"  demanded Tom.                                    144
1405607"Yes."                                                                    144
1405746"Well, you take my coupe and let me drive your                            144
1405814car to town."                                                             144
1405942The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.                                 144
1406048"I don't think there's much gas,"  he objected.                           144
1406151"Plenty of gas,"  said Tom boisterously.  He looked                       144
1406263at the gauge.  "And if it runs out I can stop at a drug-store.            144
1406348You can buy anything at a drug-store nowadays."                           145
1406451A pause followed this apparently pointless remark.                        145
1406548Daisy looked at Tom frowning, and an indefinable                          145
1406653expression, at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely                     145
1406752recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in                      145
1406834words, passed over Gatsby's face.                                         145
1406946"Come on, Daisy,"  said Tom, pressing her with                            145
1407053his hand toward Gatsby's car.  "I'll take you in this                     145
1407115circus wagon."                                                            145
1407246He opened the door, but she moved out from the                            145
1407319circle of his arm.                                                        145
1407447"You take Nick and Jordan.  We'll follow you in                           145
1407512the coupe."                                                               145
1407650She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with                        145
1407750her hand.  Jordan and Tom and I got into the front                        145
1407847seat of Gatsby's car, Tom pushed the unfamiliar                           145
1407954gears tentatively, and we shot off into the oppressive                    145
1408040heat, leaving them out of sight behind.                                   145
1408135"Did you see that?"  demanded Tom.                                        145
1408212"See what?"                                                               145
1408349He looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and                         145
1408429I must have known all along.                                              145
1408543"You think I'm pretty dumb, don't you?"  he                               145
1408649suggested.  "Perhaps I am, but I have a--almost a                         145
1408751second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do.                        145
1408846Maybe you don't believe that, but science----"                            145
1408946He paused.  The immediate contingency overtook                            145
1409061him, pulled him back from the edge of the theoretical abyss.              145
1409149"I've made a small investigation of this fellow,"                         146
1409247he continued.  "I could have gone deeper if I'd                           146
1409310known----"                                                                146
1409448"Do you mean you've been to a medium?"  inquired                          146
1409519Jordan humorously.                                                        146
1409650"What?"  Confused, he stared at us as we laughed.                         146
1409712"A medium?"                                                               146
1409816"About Gatsby."                                                           146
1409947"About Gatsby]  No, I haven't.  I said I'd been                           146
1410043making a small investigation of his past."                                146
1410143"And you found he was an Oxford man,"  said                               146
1410218Jordan helpfully.                                                         146
1410349"An Oxford man]"  He was incredulous.  "Like hell                         146
1410431he is]  He wears a pink suit."                                            146
1410535"Nevertheless he's an Oxford man."                                        146
1410650"Oxford, New Mexico,"  snorted Tom contemptuously,                        146
1410726"or something like that."                                                 146
1410849"Listen, Tom.  If you're such a snob, why did you                         146
1410948invite him to lunch?"  demanded Jordan crossly.                           146
1411042"Daisy invited him; she knew him before we                                146
1411132were married--God knows where]"                                           146
1411250We were all irritable now with the fading ale, and                        146
1411350aware of it we drove for a while in silence.  Then                        146
1411448as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg's faded eyes came into                          146
1411550sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby's caution                        146
1411616about gasoline.                                                           146
1411743"We've got enough to get us to town,"  said                               146
1411805Tom.                                                                      146
1411953"But there's a garage right here,"  objected Jordan.                      146
1412043"I don't want to get stalled in this baking                               147
1412107heat."                                                                    147
1412244Tom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we                              147
1412350slid to an abrupt dusty stop under Wilson's sign.                         147
1412455After a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior                   147
1412545of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at                             147
1412609the car.                                                                  147
1412743"Let's have some gas]"  cried Tom roughly.                                147
1412848"What do you think we stopped for--to admire the                          147
1412907view?"                                                                    147
1413047"I'm sick,"  said Wilson without moving.  "Been                           147
1413115sick all day."                                                            147
1413221"What's the matter?"                                                      147
1413320"I'm all run down."                                                       147
1413444"Well, shall I help myself?"  Tom demanded.                               147
1413540"You sounded well enough on the phone."                                   147
1413648With an effort Wilson left the shade and support                          147
1413749of the doorway and, breathing hard, unscrewed the                         147
1413854cap of the tank.  In the sunlight his face was green.                     147
1413951"I didn't mean to interrupt your lunch,"  he said.                        147
1414049"But I need money pretty bad, and I was wondering                         147
1414146what you were going to do with your old car."                             147
1414246"How do you like this one?"  inquired Tom.  "I                            147
1414322bought it last week."                                                     147
1414454"It's a nice yellow one,"  said Wilson, as he strained                    147
1414515at the handle.                                                            147
1414618"Like to buy it?"                                                         147
1414747"Big chance,"  Wilson smiled faintly.  "No, but                           147
1414839I could make some money on the other."                                    147
1414947"What do you want money for, all of a sudden?"                            148
1415047"I've been here too long.  I want to get away.                            148
1415132My wife and I want to go West."                                           148
1415244"Your wife does,"  exclaimed Tom, startled.                               148
1415348"She's been talking about it for ten years."  He                          148
1415449rested for a moment against the pump, shading his                         148
1415551eyes.  "And now she's going whether she wants to or                       148
1415634not.  I'm going to get her away."                                         148
1415749The coupe flashed by us with a flurry of dust and                         148
1415828the flash of a waving hand.                                               148
1415944"What do I owe you?"  demanded Tom harshly.                               148
1416048"I just got wised up to something funny the last                          148
1416148two days,"  remarked Wilson.  "That's why I want                          148
1416251to get away.  That's why I been bothering you about                       148
1416310the car."                                                                 148
1416421"What do I owe you?"                                                      148
1416517"Dollar twenty."                                                          148
1416652The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse                      148
1416740me and I had a bad moment there before I                                  148
1416854realized that so far his suspicions hadn't alighted on                    148
1416949Tom.  He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort                         148
1417048of life apart from him in another world, and the                          148
1417148shock had made him physically sick.  I stared at                          148
1417254him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery                    148
1417344less than an hour before--and it occurred to                              148
1417447me that there was no difference between men, in                           148
1417551intelligence or race, so profound as the difference                       148
1417650between the sick and the well.  Wilson was so sick                        148
1417752that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty--as if he                      149
1417840had just got some poor girl with child.                                   149
1417952"I'll let you have that car,"  said Tom.  "I'll send                      149
1418030it over to-morrow afternoon."                                             149
1418145That locality was always vaguely disquieting,                             149
1418247even in the broad glare of afternoon, and now I                           149
1418345turned my head as though I had been warned of                             149
1418446something behind.  Over the ashheaps the giant                            149
1418552eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil, but                      149
1418649I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were                         149
1418751regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than                       149
1418818twenty feet away.                                                         149
1418950In one of the windows over the garage the curtains                        149
1419041had been moved aside a little, and Myrtle                                 149
1419149Wilson was peering down at the car.  So engrossed                         149
1419256was she that she had no consciousness of being observed,                  149
1419340and one emotion after another crept into                                  149
1419456her face like objects into a slowly developing picture.                   149
1419545Her expression was curiously familiar--it was                             149
1419648an expression I had often seen on women's faces,                          149
1419749but on Myrtle Wilson's face it seemed purposeless                         149
1419853and inexplicable until I realized that her eyes, wide                     149
1419950with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on                        149
1420044Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.                               149
1420152There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple                      149
1420242mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling                                149
1420351the hot whips of panic.  His wife and his mistress,                       149
1420453unitl an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping                     149
1420550precipitately from his control.  Instinct made him                        150
1420650step on the accelerator with the double purpose of                        150
1420747overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and                           150
1420852we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour,                      150
1420952until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we                      150
1421044came in sight of the easy-going blue coupe.                               150
1421144"Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are                              150
1421253cool,"  suggested Jordan.  "I love New York on summer                     150
1421342afternoons when every one's away.  There's                                150
1421453something very sensuous about it--overripe, as if all                     150
1421550sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your                        150
1421608hands."                                                                   150
1421757The word "sensuous" had the effect of further disquieting                 150
1421841Tom, but before he could invent a protest                                 150
1421951the coupe came to a stop, and Daisy signalled us to                       150
1422019draw up alongside.                                                        150
1422134"Where are we going?"  she cried.                                         150
1422224"How about the movies?"                                                   150
1422348"It's so hot,"  she complained.  "You go.  We'll                          150
1422452ride around and meet you after."  With an effort her                      150
1422551wit rose faintly,  "We'll meet you on some corner.                        150
1422641I'll be the man smoking two cigarettes."                                  150
1422754"We can't argue about it here,"  Tom said impatiently,                    150
1422844as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind                              150
1422948us.  "You follow me to the south side of Central                          150
1423030Park, in front of the Plaza."                                             150
1423148Several times he turned his head and looked back                          150
1423256for their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed                  150
1423353up until they came into sight.  I think he was afraid                     150
1423454they would dart down a side street and out of his life                    151
1423509forever.                                                                  151
1423653But they didn't.  And we all took the less explicable                     151
1423751step of engaging the parlor of a suite in the Plaza                       151
1423807Hotel.                                                                    151
1423942The prolonged and tumultuous argument that                                151
1424045ended by herding us into that room eludes me,                             151
1424150though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the                        151
1424252course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp                      151
1424346snake around my legs and intermittent beads of                            151
1424455sweat raced cool across my back.  The notion originated                   151
1424552with Daisy's suggestion that we hire five bath-rooms                      151
1424642and take cold baths, and then assumed more                                151
1424749tangible form as "a place to have a mint julep."                          151
1424850Each of us said over and over that it was a "crazy                        151
1424951idea"--we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and                       151
1425050thought, or pretended to think, that we were being                        151
1425117very funny . . .                                                          151
1425247The room was large and stifling, and, though it                           151
1425354was already four o'clock, opening the windows admitted                    151
1425444Only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park.                               151
1425551Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to                       151
1425621us, fixing her hair.                                                      151
1425753"It's a swell suite,"  whispered Jordan respectfully,                     151
1425823and every one laughed.                                                    151
1425940"Open another window,"  commanded Daisy,                                  151
1426024without turning around.                                                   151
1426125"There aren't any more."                                                  151
1426244"Well, we'd better telephone for an axe----"                              151
1426352"The thing to do is to forget about the heat,"  said                      152
1426449Tom impatiently.  "You make it ten times worse by                         152
1426520crabbing about it."                                                       152
1426648He unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel                          152
1426725and put it on the table.                                                  152
1426845"Why not let her alone, old sport?"  remarked                             152
1426947Gatsby.  "You're the one that wanted to come to                           152
1427007town."                                                                    152
1427145There was a moment of silence.  The telephone                             152
1427253book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor,                     152
1427345whereupon Jordan whispered,  "Excuse me"--but                             152
1427426this time no one laughed.                                                 152
1427531"I'll pick it up,"  I offered.                                            152
1427650"I've got it."  Gatsby examined the parted string,                        152
1427748muttered "Hum]" in an interested way, and tossed                          152
1427821the book on a chair.                                                      152
1427953"That's a great expression of yours, isn't it?"  said                     152
1428013Tom sharply.                                                              152
1428111"What is?"                                                                152
1428249"All this 'old sport' business.  Where'd you pick                         152
1428310that up?"                                                                 152
1428448"Now see here, Tom,"  said Daisy, turning around                          152
1428551from the mirror,  "if you're going to make personal                       152
1428648remarks I won't stay here a minute.  Call up and                          152
1428736order some ice for the mint julep."                                       152
1428842As Tom took up the receiver the compressed                                152
1428946heat exploded into sound and we were listening                            152
1429049to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn's Wedding                         152
1429131March from the ballroom below.                                            152
1429247"Imagine marrying anybody in this heat]"  cried                           153
1429317Jordan dismally.                                                          153
1429445"Still--i was married in the middle of June,"                             153
1429549Daisy remembered,  "Louisville in June]  Somebody                         153
1429636fainted.  Who was it fainted, Tom?"                                       153
1429732"Biloxi,"  he answered shortly.                                           153
1429845"A man named Biloxi.  'blocks' Biloxi, and he                             153
1429950made boxes--that's a fact--and he was from Biloxi,                        153
1430012Tennessee."                                                               153
1430143"They carried him into my house,"  appended                               153
1430250Jordan,  "because we lived just two doors from the                        153
1430347church.  And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy                           153
1430450told him he had to get out.  The day after he left                        153
1430567Daddy died."  After a moment she added as if she might have sounded       153
1430644irreverent,  "There wasn't any connection."                               153
1430744"I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,"                              153
1430812I remarked.                                                               153
1430946"That was his cousin.  I knew his whole family                            153
1431047history before he left.  He gave me an aluminum                           153
1431127putter that I use to-day."                                                153
1431245The music had died down as the ceremony began                             153
1431346and now a long cheer floated in at the window,                            153
1431449followed by intermittent cries of "Yea--ea--ea]"                          153
1431553and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.                      153
1431646"We're getting old,"  said Daisy.  "If we were                            153
1431728young we'd rise and dance."                                               153
1431848"Remember Biloxi,"  Jordan warned her.  "Where'd                          153
1431920you know him, Tom?"                                                       153
1432046"Biloxi?"  He concentrated with an effort.  "I                            154
1432147didn't know him.  He was a friend of Daisy's."                            154
1432247"He was not,"  she denied.  "I'd never seen him                           154
1432343before.  He came down in the private car."                                154
1432450"Well, he said he knew you.  He said he was raised                        154
1432550in Louisville.  Asa Bird brought him around at the                        154
1432647last minute and asked if we had room for him."                            154
1432715Jordan smiled.                                                            154
1432842"He was probably bumming his way home.  He                                154
1432949told me he was president of your class at Yale."                          154
1433040Tom and I looked at each other blankly.                                   154
1433110"BiloxI?"                                                                 154
1433247"First place, we didn't have any president----"                           154
1433347Gatsby's foot beat a short, restless tattoo and                           154
1433423Tom eyed him suddenly.                                                    154
1433547"By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you're an                           154
1433613Oxford man."                                                              154
1433715"Not exactly."                                                            154
1433844"Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford."                               154
1433921"Yes--i went there."                                                      154
1434054A pause.  Then Tom's voice, incredulous and insulting:                    154
1434147"You must have gone there about the time Biloxi                           154
1434220went to New Haven."                                                       154
1434344Another pause.  A waiter knocked and came in                              154
1434455with crushed mint and ice but, the silence was unbroken                   154
1434542by his "thank you" and the soft closing of                                154
1434651the door.  This tremendous detail was to be cleared                       154
1434712up at last.                                                               154
1434841"I told you I went there,"  said Gatsby.                                  155
1434942"I heard you, but I'd like to know when."                                 155
1435048"It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five                          155
1435149months.  That's why I can't really call myself an                         155
1435213Oxford man."                                                              155
1435355Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief.                    155
1435435But we were all looking at Gatsby.                                        155
1435543"It was an opportunity they gave to some of                               155
1435654the officers after the Armistice,"  he continued.  "We                    155
1435749could go to any of the universities in England or                         155
1435809France."                                                                  155
1435947I wanted to get up and slap him on the back.  I                           155
1436050had one of those renewals of complete faith in him                        155
1436129that I'd experienced before.                                              155
1436252Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.                       155
1436349"Open the whiskey, Tom,"  she ordered,  "and I'll                         155
1436446make you a mint julep.  Then you won't seem so                            155
1436546stupid to yourself. . . .  look at the mint]"                             155
1436646"Wait a minute,"  snapped Tom,  "I want to ask                            155
1436731Mr. Gatsby one more question."                                            155
1436832"Go on,"  Gatsby said politely.                                           155
1436949"What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my                         155
1437015house anyhow?"                                                            155
1437148They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was                          155
1437209content.                                                                  155
1437351"He isn't causing a row."  Daisy looked desperately                       155
1437447from one to the other.  "You're causing a row.                            155
1437536Please have a little self-control."                                       155
1437648"Self-control]"  Repeated Tom incredulously.  "I                          155
1437752suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr.                       156
1437844Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife.                               156
1437953Well, if that's the idea you can count me out. . . .                      156
1438048nowadays people begin by sneering at family life                          156
1438158and family institutions, and next they'll throw everything                156
1438240overboard and have intermarriage between                                  156
1438318black and white."                                                         156
1438446Flushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw                            156
1438560himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization.               156
1438642"We're all white here,"  murmured Jordan.                                 156
1438747"I know I'm not very popular.  I don't give big                           156
1438849parties.  I suppose you've got to make your house                         156
1438950into a pigsty in order to have any friends--in the                        156
1439015modern world."                                                            156
1439145Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted                             156
1439254to laugh whenever he opened his mouth.  The transition                    156
1439340from libertine to prig was so complete.                                   156
1439452"I've got something to tell you, old sport--"  began                      156
1439545Gatsby.  But Daisy guessed at his intention.                              156
1439653"Please don't]"  she interrupted helplessly.  "Please                     156
1439747let's all go home.  Why don't we all go home?"                            156
1439849"That's a good idea."  I got up.  "Come on, Tom.                          156
1439923Nobody wants a drink."                                                    156
1440049"I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me."                          156
1440151"Your wife doesn't love you,"  said Gatsby.  "She's                       156
1440233never loved you.  She loves me."                                          156
1440351"You must be crazy]"  exclaimed Tom automatically.                        156
1440450Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.                         157
1440547"She never loved you, do you hear?"  he cried.                            157
1440648"She only married you because I was poor and she                          157
1440756was tired of waiting for me.  It was a terrible mistake,                  157
1440847but in her heart she never loved any one except                           157
1440905me]"                                                                      157
1441047At this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom                           157
1441150and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that                        157
1441249we remain--as though neither of them had anything                         157
1441349to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake                         157
1441431vicariously of their emotions.                                            157
1441553"Sit down, Daisy,"  Tom's voice groped unsuccessfully                     157
1441642for the paternal note.  "What's been going                                157
1441735on?  I want to hear all about it."                                        157
1441849"I told you what's been going on,"  said Gatsby.                          157
1441948"Going on for five years--and you didn't know."                           157
1442029Tom turned to Daisy sharply.                                              157
1442149"You've been seeing this fellow for five years?"                          157
1442245"Not seeing,"  said Gatsby.  "No, we couldn't                             157
1442353meet.  But both of us loved each other all that time,                     157
1442448old sport, and you didn't know.  I used to laugh                          157
1442554sometimes"--but there was no laughter in his eyes--"to                    157
1442629think that you didn't know."                                              157
1442747"Oh--that's all."  Tom tapped his thick fingers                           157
1442848together like a clergyman and leaned back in his                          157
1442907chair.                                                                    157
1443045"You're crazy]"  he exploded.  "I can't speak                             157
1443152about what happened five years ago, because I didn't                      157
1443248know Daisy then--and I'll be damned if I see how                          157
1443351you got within a mile of her unless you brought the                       158
1443455groceries to the back door.  But all the rest of that's                   158
1443550a God damned lie.  Daisy loved me when she married                        158
1443626me and she loves me now."                                                 158
1443738"No,"  said Gatsby, shaking his head.                                     158
1443849"She does, though.  The trouble is that sometimes                         158
1443951she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn't know                       158
1444050what she's doing."  He nodded sagely.  "And what's                        158
1444152more, I love Daisy too.  Once in a while I go off on                      158
1444252a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come                      158
1444348back, and in my heart I love her all the time."                           158
1444451"You're revolting,"  said Daisy.  She turned to me,                       158
1444551and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the                       158
1444647room with thrilling scorn:  "Do you know why we                           158
1444751left Chicago?  I'm surprised that they didn't treat                       158
1444840you to the story of that little spree."                                   158
1444941Gatsby walked over and stood beside her.                                  158
1445050"Daisy, that's all over now,"  he said earnestly.                         158
1445147"It doesn't matter any more.  Just tell him the                           158
1445251truth--that you never loved him--and it's all wiped                       158
1445314out forever."                                                             158
1445445She looked at him blindly.  "Why--how could I                             158
1445521love him--possibly?"                                                      158
1445623"You never loved him."                                                    158
1445751She hesitated.  Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with                       158
1445853a sort of appeal, as though she realized at last what                     158
1445947she was doing--and as though she had never, all                           158
1446050along, intended doing anything at all.  But it was                        158
1446128done now.  It was too late.                                               158
1446248"I never loved him,"  she said, with perceptible                          159
1446312reluctance.                                                               159
1446444"Not at Kapiolani?"  demanded Tom suddenly.                               159
1446506"No."                                                                     159
1446650From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating                        159
1446739chords were drifting up on hot waves of                                   159
1446805air.                                                                      159
1446947"Not that day I carried you down from the Punch                           159
1447048Bowl to keep your shoes dry?"  There was a husky                          159
1447139tenderness in his tone. . . . "daisy?"                                    159
1447251"Please don't."  Her voice was cold, but the rancor                       159
1447349was gone from it.  She looked at Gatsby.  "There,                         159
1447453Jay,"  she said--but her hand as she tried to light a                     159
1447548cigarette was trembling.  Suddenly she threw the                          159
1447647cigarette and the burning match on the carpet.                            159
1447747"Oh, you want too much]"  she cried to Gatsby.                            159
1447849"I love you now--isn't that enough?  I can't help                         159
1447951what's past."  She began to sob helplessly.  "I did                       159
1448037love him once--but I loved you too."                                      159
1448133Gatsby's eyes opened and closed.                                          159
1448234"You loved me too?"  he repeated.                                         159
1448346"Even that's a lie,"  said Tom savagely.  "She                            159
1448449didn't know you were alive.  Why--there're things                         159
1448551between Daisy and me that you'll never know, things                       159
1448637that neither of us can ever forget."                                      159
1448749The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.                          159
1448848"I want to speak to Daisy alone,"  he insisted.                           159
1448927"She's all excited now----"                                               159
1449043"Even alone I can't say I never loved Tom,"                               159
1449149she admitted in a pitiful voice.  "It wouldn't be                         160
1449207true."                                                                    160
1449338"Of course it wouldn't,"  agreed Tom.                                     160
1449427She turned to her husband.                                                160
1449539"As if it mattered to you,"  she said.                                    160
1449648"Of course it matters.  I'm going to take better                          160
1449726care of you from now on."                                                 160
1449844"You don't understand,"  said Gatsby, with a                              160
1449954touch of panic.  "You're not going to take care of her                    160
1450011any more."                                                                160
1450140"I'm not?"  Tom opened his eyes wide and                                  160
1450250laughed.  He could afford to control himself now.                         160
1450314"Why's that?"                                                             160
1450423"Daisy's leaving you."                                                    160
1450512"Nonsense."                                                               160
1450649"I am, though,"  she said with a visible effort.                          160
1450745"She's not leaving me]"  Tom's words suddenly                             160
1450853leaned down over Gatsby.  "Certainly not for a common                     160
1450947swindler who'd have to steal the ring he put on                           160
1451013her finger."                                                              160
1451148"I won't stand this]"  cried Daisy.  "Oh, please                          160
1451216let's get out."                                                           160
1451347"Who are you, anyhow?"  broke out Tom.  "You're                           160
1451446one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer                            160
1451544Wolfshiem--that much I happen to know.  I've                              160
1451655made a little investigation into your affairs--and I'll                   160
1451729carry it further to-morrow."                                              160
1451852"You can suit yourself about that, old sport."  said                      160
1451917Gatsby steadily.                                                          160
1452047"I found out what your 'drug-stores' were."  He                           161
1452155turned to us and spoke rapidly.  "He and this Wolfshiem                   161
1452247bought up a lot of side-street drug-stores here                           161
1452346and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the                            161
1452452counter.  That's one of his little stunts.  I picked                      161
1452552him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I                      161
1452619wasn't far wrong."                                                        161
1452749"What about it?"  said Gatsby politely.  "I guess                         161
1452849your friend Walter Chase wasn't too proud to come                         161
1452911in on it."                                                                161
1453048"And you left him in the lurch, didn't you?  You                          161
1453151let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey.                        161
1453248God]  You ought to hear Walter on the subject of                          161
1453306you."                                                                     161
1453447"He came to us dead broke.  He was very glad to                           161
1453532pick up some money, old sport."                                           161
1453645"Don't you call me 'old sport']"  cried Tom.                              161
1453750Gatsby said nothing.  "Walter could have you up on                        161
1453851the betting laws too, but Wolfshiem scared him into                       161
1453921shutting his mouth."                                                      161
1454046That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back                            161
1454124again in Gatsby's face.                                                   161
1454249"That drug-store business was just small change,"                         161
1454348continued Tom slowly,  "but you've got something                          161
1454447on now that Walter's afraid to tell me about."                            161
1454553I glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between                     161
1454642Gatsby and her husband, and at Jordan, who                                161
1454748had begun to balanace an invisible but absorbing                          161
1454853object on the tip of her chin.  Then I turned back to                     161
1454947Gatsby--and was startled at his expression.  He                           162
1455056looked--and this is said in all contempt for the babbled                  162
1455145slander of his garden--as if he had "killed a                             162
1455248man."  For a moment the set of his face could be                          162
1455338described in just that fantastic way.                                     162
1455451It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy,                       162
1455546denying everything, defending his name against                            162
1455651accusations that had not been made.  But with every                       162
1455754word she was drawing further and further into herself,                    162
1455843so he gave that up, and only the dead dream                               162
1455950fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to                        162
1456056touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily,                  162
1456138undespairingly, toward that lost voice                                    162
1456217across the room.                                                          162
1456330The voice begged again to go.                                             162
1456445"Please, Tom]  I can't stand this any more."                              162
1456550Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions,                        162
1456653whatever courage, she had had, were definitely gone.                      162
1456747"You two start on home, Daisy,"  said Tom.  "In                           162
1456819Mr. Gatsby's car."                                                        162
1456947She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted                           162
1457024with magnanimous scorn.                                                   162
1457149"Go on.  He won't annoy you.  I think he realizes                         162
1457250that his presumptuous little flirtation is over."                         162
1457344They were gone, without a word, snapped out,                              162
1457453made accidental, isolated, like ghosts, even from our                     162
1457506pity.                                                                     162
1457644After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping                              162
1457745the unopened bottle of whiskey in the towel.                              162
1457847"Want any of this stuff?  Jordan? . . . nick?"                            162
1457917I didn't answer.                                                          163
1458025"Nick?"  He asked again.                                                  163
1458108"What?"                                                                   163
1458212"Want any?"                                                               163
1458344"No . . . I just remembered that to-day's my                              163
1458411birthday."                                                                163
1458550I was thirty.  Before me stretched the portentous,                        163
1458631menacing road of a new decade.                                            163
1458747It was seven o'clock when we got into the coupe                           163
1458849with him and started for Long Island.  Tom talked                         163
1458953incessantly, exulting and laughing, but his voice was                     163
1459050as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamor                        163
1459156on the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead.                   163
1459242Human sympathy has its limits, and we were                                163
1459351content to let all their tragic arguments fade with                       163
1459449the city lights behind.  Thirty--the promise of a                         163
1459554decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to                    163
1459651know, a thinning brief-case of enthusiasm, thinning                       163
1459750hair.  But there was Jordan beside me, who, unlike                        163
1459848Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten                          163
1459951dreams from age to age.  As we passed over the dark                       163
1460049bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coat's                         163
1460149shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died                         163
1460247away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.                            163
1460347So we drove on toward death through the cooling                           163
1460410twilight.                                                                 163
1460546The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee                            163
1460651joint beside the ashheaps was the principal witness                       163
1460752at the inquest.  He had slept through the heat until                      163
1460852after five, when he strolled over to the garage, and                      164
1460952found George Wilson sick in his office--really sick,                      164
1461058pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over.  Michaelis                164
1461145advised him to go to bed, but Wilson refused,                             164
1461257saying that he'd miss a lot of business if he did.  While                 164
1461349his neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent                         164
1461427racket broke out overhead.                                                164
1461549"I've got my wife locked in up there,"  explained                         164
1461651Wilson calmly.  "She's going to stay there till the                       164
1461749day after to-morrow, and then we're going to move                         164
1461807away."                                                                    164
1461949Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors                         164
1462043for four years, and Wilson had never seemed                               164
1462147faintly capable of such a statement.  Generally                           164
1462249he was one of these worn-out men:  when he wasn't                         164
1462352working, he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared                      164
1462448at the people and the cars that passed along the                          164
1462546road.  When any one spoke to him he invariably                            164
1462651laughed in an agreeable, colorless way.  He was his                       164
1462728wife's man and not his own.                                               164
1462849So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had                         164
1462949happened, but Wilson wouldn't say a word--instead                         164
1463052he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his                      164
1463151visitor and ask him what he'd been doing at certain                       164
1463246times on certain days.  Just as the latter was                            164
1463347getting uneasy, some workmen came past the door                           164
1463460bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis took the opportunity              164
1463543to get away, intending to come back later.                                164
1463654But he didn't.  He supposed he forgot to, that's all.                     164
1463752When he came outside again, a little after seven, he                      164
1463849was reminded of the conversation because he heard                         165
1463951Mrs. Wilson's voice, loud and scolding, down-stairs                       165
1464015in the garage.                                                            165
1464145"Beat me]"  he heard her cry.  "Throw me down                             165
1464239and beat me, you dirty little coward]"                                    165
1464344A moment later she rushed out into the dusk,                              165
1464446waving her hands and shouting--before he could                            165
1464542move from his door the business was over.                                 165
1464644The "death car" as the newspapers called it,                              165
1464751didn't stop; it came out of the gathering darkness,                       165
1464853wavered tragically for a moment, and then disappeared                     165
1464932around the next bend.  Michaelis                                          165
1465058wasn't even sure of its color--he told the first policeman                165
1465148that it was light green.  The other car, the one                          165
1465245going toward New York, came to rest a hundred                             165
1465350yards beyond, and its driver hurried back to where                        165
1465453Myrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt                     165
1465549in the road and mingled her thick dark blood with                         165
1465610the dust.                                                                 165
1465745Michaelis and this man reached her first, but                             165
1465850when they had torn open her shirtwaist, still damp                        165
1465952with perspiration, they saw that her left breast was                      165
1466052swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to                      165
1466149listen for the heart beneath.  The mouth was wide                         165
1466241open and ripped at the corners, as though                                 165
1466351she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous                       165
1466433vitality she had stored so long.                                          165
1466544We saw the three or four automobiles and the                              165
1466645crowd when we were still some distance away.                              165
1466745"Wreck]"  said Tom.  "That's good.  Wilson'll                             166
1466833have a little business at last."                                          166
1466947He slowed down, but still without any intention                           166
1467050of stopping, until, as we came nearer, the hushed,                        166
1467150intent faces of the people at the garage door made                        166
1467237him automatically put on the brakes.                                      166
1467350"We'll take a look,"  he said doubtfully,  "just a                        166
1467407look."                                                                    166
1467545I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound                             166
1467649which issued incessantly from the garage, a sound                         166
1467750which as we got out of the coupe and walked toward                        166
1467847the door resolved itself into the words "Oh, my                           166
1467947God]" uttered over and over in a gasping moan.                            166
1468054"There's some bad trouble here,"  said Tom excitedly.                     166
1468149He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle                         166
1468249of heads into the garage, which was lit only by a                         166
1468349yellow light in a swinging wire basket overhead.                          166
1468450Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with                        166
1468549a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms                         166
1468624pushed his way through.                                                   166
1468748The circle closed up again with a running murmur                          166
1468852of expostulation; it was a minute before I could see                      166
1468948anything at all.  Then new arrivals deranged the                          166
1469052line, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.                       166
1469147Myrtle Wilson's body, wrapped in a blanket, and                           166
1469252then in another blanket, as though she suffered from                      166
1469352a chill in the hot night, lay on a work-table by the                      166
1469447wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending                           167
1469552over it, motionless.  Next to him stood a motorcycle                      167
1469637policeman taking down names with much                                     167
1469750sweat and correction in a little book.  At first I                        167
1469852couldn't find the source of the high, groaning words                      167
1469953that echoed clamorously through the bare garage--then                     167
1470045I saw Wilson standing on the raised threshold                             167
1470152of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to                      167
1470244the doorposts with both hands.  Some man was                              167
1470350talking to him in a low voice and attempting, from                        167
1470448time to time, to lay a hand on his shoulder, but                          167
1470550Wilson neither heard nor saw.  His eyes would drop                        167
1470652slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by                      167
1470752the wall, and then jerk back to the light again, and                      167
1470848he gave out incessantly his high, horrible call:                          167
1470944"Oh, my Ga-od]  Oh, my Ga-od] oh, Ga-od] oh,                              167
1471011my Ga-od]"                                                                167
1471146Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and,                            167
1471249after staring around the garage with glazed eyes,                         167
1471344addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the                              167
1471411policeman.                                                                167
1471547"M-a-v--"  the policeman was saying,  "--o----"                           167
1471646"No, r--"  corrected the man,  "M-a-v-r-o----"                            167
1471740"Listen to me]"  muttered Tom fiercely.                                   167
1471835"r--"  said the policeman,  "o----"                                       167
1471907"g----"                                                                   167
1472044"g--"  He looked up as Tom's broad hand fell                              167
1472150sharply on his shoulder.  "What you want, fella?"                         167
1472246"What happened?--that's what I want to know."                             167
1472335"Auto hit her.  Ins'antly killed."                                        168
1472444"Instantly killed,"  repeated Tom, staring.                               168
1472550"She ran out ina road.  Son-of-a-bitch didn't even                        168
1472613stopus car."                                                              168
1472744"There was two cars,"  said Michaelis,  "one                              168
1472825comin', one goin', see?"                                                  168
1472944"Going where?"  asked the policeman keenly.                               168
1473042"One goin' each way.  Well, she"--his hand                                168
1473149rose toward the blankets but stopped half way and                         168
1473248fell to his side--"she ran out there an' the one                          168
1473346comin' from N'york knock right into her, goin'                            168
1473432thirty or forty miles an hour."                                           168
1473547"What's the name of this place here?"  demanded                           168
1473613the officer.                                                              168
1473723"Hasn't got any name."                                                    168
1473840A pale well-dressed negro stepped near.                                   168
1473951"It was a yellow car,"  he said,  "big yellow car.                        168
1474006New."                                                                     168
1474142"See the accident?"  asked the policeman.                                 168
1474247"No, but the car passed me down the road, going                           168
1474338faster'n forty.  Going fifty, sixty."                                     168
1474446"Come here and let's have your name.  Look out                            168
1474531now.  I want to get his name."                                            168
1474649Some words of this conversation must have reached                         168
1474750Wilson, swaying in the office door, for suddenly a                        168
1474846new theme found voice among his gasping cries:                            168
1474946"You don't have to tell me what kind of car it                            168
1475039was]  I know what kind of car it was]"                                    168
1475145Watching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of                             168
1475247his shoulder tighten under his coat.  He walked                           169
1475348quickly over to Wilson and, standing in front of                          169
1475442him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.                                 169
1475548"You've got to pull yourself together,"  he said                          169
1475625with soothing gruffness.                                                  169
1475749Wilson's eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his                         169
1475850tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees                        169
1475930had not Tom held him upright.                                             169
1476051"Listen,"  said Tom, shaking him a little.  "I just                       169
1476144got here a minute ago, from New York.  I was                              169
1476250bringing you that coupe we've been talking about.                         169
1476351That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn't                       169
1476454mine--do you hear?  I haven't seen it all afternoon."                     169
1476545Only the negro and I were near enough to hear                             169
1476648what he said, but the policeman caught something                          169
1476749in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes.                          169
1476833"What's all that?"  he demanded.                                          169
1476947"I'm a friend of his."  Tom turned his head but                           169
1477047kept his hands firm on Wilson's body.  "He says                           169
1477148he knows the car that did it.... it was a yellow                          169
1477206car."                                                                     169
1477344Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look                              169
1477421suspiciously at Tom.                                                      169
1477529"And what color's your car?"                                              169
1477628"It's a blue car, a coupe."                                               169
1477746"We've come straight from New York,"  I said.                             169
1477848Some one who had been driving a little behind us                          169
1477947confirmed this, and the policeman turned away.                            169
1478056"Now, if you'll let me have that name again correct----"                  170
1478146Picking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him                            170
1478250into the office, set him down in a chair, and came                        170
1478306back.                                                                     170
1478448"If somebody'll come here and sit with him,"  he                          170
1478550snapped authoritatively.  He watched while the two                        170
1478651men standing closest glanced at each other and went                       170
1478750unwillingly into the room.  Then Tom shut the door                        170
1478847on them and came down the single step, his eyes                           170
1478948avoiding the table.  As he passed close to me he                          170
1479029whispered:  "Let's get out."                                              170
1479154Self-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking                    170
1479246the way, we pushed through the still gathering                            170
1479350crowd, passing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who                        170
1479449had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.                          170
1479552Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend--then                      170
1479638his foot came down hard, and the coupe                                    170
1479751raced along through the night.  In a little while I                       170
1479850heard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were                        170
1479927overflowing down his face.                                                170
1480044"The God damned coward]"  he whimpered.  "He                              170
1480127didn't even stop his car."                                                170
1480247The Buchanans' house floated suddenly toward us                           170
1480352through the dark rustling trees.  Tom stopped beside                      170
1480444the porch and looked up at the second floor,                              170
1480546where two windows bloomed with light among the                            170
1480607vines.                                                                    170
1480747"Daisy's home,"  he said.  As we got out of the                           171
1480843car he glanced at me and frowned slightly.                                171
1480948"I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick.                           171
1481037There's nothing we can do to-night."                                      171
1481140A change had come over him, and he spoke                                  171
1481248gravely, and with decision.  As we walked across                          171
1481352the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the                      171
1481434situation in a few brisk phrases.                                         171
1481548"I'll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and                          171
1481648while you're waiting you and Jordan better go in                          171
1481749the kitchen and have them get you some supper--if                         171
1481842you want any."  He opened the door.  "Come                                171
1481905in."                                                                      171
1482047"No, thanks.  But I'd be glad if you'd order me                           171
1482131the taxi.  I'll wait outside."                                            171
1482231Jordan put her hand on my arm.                                            171
1482327"Won't you come in, Nick?"                                                171
1482414"No, thanks."                                                             171
1482554I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone.                     171
1482639But Jordan lingered for a moment more.                                    171
1482739"It's only half-past nine,"  she said.                                    171
1482850I'd be damned if I'd go in;  I'd had enough of all                        171
1482947of them for one day, and suddenly that included                           171
1483049Jordan too.  She must have seen something of this                         171
1483150in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and                        171
1483250ran up the porch steps into the house.  I sat down                        171
1483349for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until                         171
1483450I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler's                        171
1483552voice calling a taxi.  Then I walked slowly down the                      171
1483651drive away from the house, intending to wait by the                       172
1483706gate.                                                                     172
1483842I hadn't gone twenty yards when I heard my                                172
1483947name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes                           172
1484048into the path.  I must have felt pretty weird by                          172
1484150that time, because I could think of nothing except                        172
1484248the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon.                           172
1484335"What are you doing?"  I inquired.                                        172
1484433"Just standing here, old sport."                                          172
1484546Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation.                             172
1484649For all I knew he was going to rob the house in a                         172
1484754moment; I wouldn't have been surprised to see sinister                    172
1484848faces, the faces of "Wolfshiem's people," behind                          172
1484927him in the dark shrubbery.                                                172
1485048"Did you see any trouble on the road?"  he asked                          172
1485116after a minute.                                                           172
1485207"Yes."                                                                    172
1485314He hesitated.                                                             172
1485418"Was she killed?"                                                         172
1485507"Yes."                                                                    172
1485647"I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so.  It's                           172
1485751better that the shock should all come at once.  She                       172
1485823stood it pretty well."                                                    172
1485950He spoke as if Daisy's reaction was the only thing                        172
1486015that mattered.                                                            172
1486148"I got to West Egg by a side road,"  he went on,                          172
1486254"and left the car in my garage.  I don't think anybody                    172
1486340saw us, but of course I can't be sure."                                   172
1486449I disliked him so much by this time that I didn't                         172
1486544find it necessary to tell him he was wrong.                               172
1486635"Who was the woman?"  he inquired.                                        173
1486743"Her name was Wilson.  Her husband owns the                               173
1486839garage.  How the devil did it happen?"                                    173
1486946"Well, I tried to swing the wheel--"  He broke                            173
1487042off, and suddenly I guessed at the truth.                                 173
1487121"Was Daisy driving?"                                                      173
1487247"Yes,"  he said after a moment,  "but of course                           173
1487351I'll say I was.  You see, when we left New York she                       173
1487448was very nervous and she thought it would steady                          173
1487550her to drive--and this woman rushed out at us just                        173
1487650as we were passing a car coming the other way.  It                        173
1487750all happened in a minute, but it seemed to me that                        173
1487851she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody                       173
1487945she knew.  Well, first Daisy turned away from                             173
1488049the woman toward the other car, and then she lost                         173
1488146her nerve and turned back.  The second my hand                            173
1488248reached the wheel I felt the shock--it must have                          173
1488323killed her instantly."                                                    173
1488424"It ripped her open----"                                                  173
1488555"Don't tell me, old sport."  He winced.  "Anyhow--Daisy                   173
1488641stepped on it.  I tried to make her stop,                                 173
1488754but she couldn't, so I pulled on the emergency brake.                     173
1488847Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.                            173
1488953"She'll be all right to-morrow,"  he said presently.                      173
1489051"I'm just going to wait here and see if he tries to                       173
1489153bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon.                      173
1489255She's locked herself into her room, and if he tries any                   173
1489350brutality she's going to turn the light out and on                        173
1489408again."                                                                   173
1489550"He won't touch her,'  I said.  "He's not thinking                        174
1489612about her."                                                               174
1489732"I don't trust him, old sport."                                           174
1489834"How long are you going to wait?"                                         174
1489951"All night, if necessary.  Anyhow, till they all go                       174
1490009to bed."                                                                  174
1490148A new point of view occurred to me.  Suppose Tom                          174
1490248found out that Daisy had been driving.  He might                          174
1490358think he saw a connection in it--he might think anything.                 174
1490446I looked at the house; there were two or three                            174
1490549bright windows down-stairs and the pink glow from                         174
1490634Daisy's room on the second floor.                                         174
1490751"You wait here,"  I said.  "I'll see if there's any                       174
1490822sign of a commotion."                                                     174
1490953I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed                     174
1491045the gravel softly, and tiptoed up the veranda                             174
1491150steps.  The drawing-room curtains were open, and I                        174
1491248saw that the room was empty.  Crossing the porch                          174
1491347where we had dined that June night three months                           174
1491452before, I came to a small rectangle of light which I                      174
1491545guessed was the pantry window.  The blind was                             174
1491639drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.                                    174
1491746Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other                            174
1491848at the kitchen table, with a plate of cold fried                          174
1491949chicken between them, and two bottles of ale.  He                         174
1492052was talking intently across the table at her, and in                      174
1492152his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered                      174
1492242her own.  Once in a while she looked up at                                174
1492329him and nodded in agreement.                                              174
1492443They weren't happy, and neither of them had                               175
1492552touched the chicken or the ale--and yet they weren't                      175
1492649unhappy either.  There was an unmistakable air of                         175
1492747natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody                           175
1492852would have said that they were conspiring together.                       175
1492951As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling                       175
1493046its way along the dark road toward the house.                             175
1493146Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in the                            175
1493207drive.                                                                    175
1493349"Is it all quiet up there?"  he asked anxiously.                          175
1493451"Yes, it's all quiet."  I hesitated.  "You'd better                       175
1493531come home and get some sleep."                                            175
1493619He shook his head.                                                        175
1493750"I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed.  Good                        175
1493819night, old sport."                                                        175
1493947He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned                           175
1494052back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though                      175
1494151my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil.  So                       175
1494248I walked away and left him standing there in the                          175
1494334moonlight--watching over nothing.                                         175
1494412CHAPTER VIII                                                              176
1494551I COULDN'T sleep all night; a fog-horn was groaning                       176
1494648incessantly on the Sound, and I tossed half-sick                          176
1494749between grotesque reality and savage, frightening                         176
1494850dreams.  Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby's                        176
1494942drive, and immediately I jumped out of bed                                176
1495050and began to dress--i felt that I had something to                        176
1495150tell him, something to warn him about, and morning                        176
1495219would be too late.                                                        176
1495348Crossing his lawn, I saw that his front door was                          176
1495452still open and he was leaning against a table in the                      176
1495537hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.                                      176
1495647"Nothing happened,"  he said wanly.  "I waited,                           176
1495749and about four o'clock she came to the window and                         176
1495848stood there for a minute and then turned out the                          176
1495908light."                                                                   176
1496044His house had never seemed so enormous to me                              176
1496147as it did that night when we hunted through the                           176
1496253great rooms for cigarettes.  We pushed aside curtains                     176
1496351that were like pavilions, and felt over innumerable                       176
1496451feet of dark wall for electric light switches--once                       176
1496545I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys                             176
1496653of a ghostly piano.  There was an inexplicable amount                     176
1496748of dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty, as                          176
1496847though they hadn't been aired for many days.  I                           176
1496950found the humidor on an unfamiliar table, with two                        176
1497048stale, dry cigarettes inside.  Throwing open the                          177
1497150French windows of the drawing-room, we sat smoking                        177
1497223out into the darkness.                                                    177
1497354"You ought to go away,"  I said.  "It's pretty certain                    177
1497425they'll trace your car."                                                  177
1497526"Go away now, old sport?"                                                 177
1497653"Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal."                      177
1497746He wouldn't consider it.  He couldn't possibly                            177
1497847leave Daisy until he knew what she was going to                           177
1497945do.  He was clutching at some last hope and I                             177
1498033couldn't bear to shake him free.                                          177
1498151It was this night that he told me the strange story                       177
1498249of his youth with Dan Cody--told it to me because                         177
1498351"Jay Gatsby" had broken up like glass against Tom's                       177
1498449hard malice, and the long secret extravaganza was                         177
1498552played out.  I think that he would have acknowledged                      177
1498644anything now, without reserve, but he wanted                              177
1498721to talk about Daisy.                                                      177
1498849She was the first "nice" girl he had ever known.                          177
1498947In various unrevealed capacities he had come in                           177
1499055contact with such people, but always with indiscernible                   177
1499145barbed wire between.  He found her excitingly                             177
1499247desirable.  He went to her house, at first with                           177
1499348other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone.  It                          177
1499449amazed him--he had never been in such a beautiful                         177
1499551house before. but what gave it an air of breathless                       177
1499648intensity, was that Daisy lived there--it was as                          177
1499752casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to                      177
1499850him.  There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of                        178
1499947bedrooms up-stairs more beautiful and cool than                           178
1500052other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking                      178
1500149place through its corridors, and of romances that                         178
1500248were not musty and laid away already in lavender                          178
1500351but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year's                       178
1500451shining motor-cars and of dances whose flowers were                       178
1500550scarcely withered.  It excited him, too, that many                        178
1500651men had already loved Daisy--it increased her value                       178
1500750in his eyes.  He felt their presence all about the                        178
1500851house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes                       178
1500927of still vibrant emotions.                                                178
1501045But he knew that he was in Daisy's house by a                             178
1501149colossal accident.  However glorious might be his                         178
1501251future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless                       178
1501343young man without a past, and at any moment                               178
1501450the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from                        178
1501552his shoulders.  So he made the most of his time.  He                      178
1501665took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously--eventually         178
1501731he took Daisy one still October                                           178
1501847night, took her because he had no real right to                           178
1501916touch her hand.                                                           178
1502042He might have despised himself, for he had                                178
1502151certainly taken her under false pretenses.  I don't                       178
1502248mean that he had traded on his phantom millions,                          178
1502356but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security;                  178
1502444he let her believe that he was a person from                              178
1502551much the same stratum as herself--that he was fully                       178
1502654able to take care of her.  As a matter of fact, he had                    178
1502748no such facilities--he had no comfortable family                          179
1502850standing behind him, and he was liable at the whim                        179
1502948of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere                          179
1503017about the world.                                                          179
1503152But he didn't despise himself and it didn't turn out                      179
1503250as he had imagined.  He had intended, probably, to                        179
1503348take what he could and go--but now he found that                          179
1503446he had committed himself to the following of a                            179
1503549grail.  He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but                         179
1503649he didn't realize just how extraordinary a "nice"                         179
1503754girl could be.  She vanished into her rich house, into                    179
1503854her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby--nothing.  He felt                    179
1503930married to her, that was all.                                             179
1504043When they met again, two days later, it was                               179
1504155Gatsby who was breathless, who was, somehow, betrayed.                    179
1504236Her porch was bright with the bought                                      179
1504355luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked                   179
1504450fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed                        179
1504547her curious and lovely mouth.  She had caught a                           179
1504653cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming                     179
1504740than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly                                  179
1504852aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons                      179
1504939and preserves, of the freshness of many                                   179
1505053clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and                     179
1505143proud above the hot struggles of the poor.                                179
1505247"I can't describe to you how surprised I was to                           179
1505350find out I loved her, old sport.  I even hoped for                        179
1505457a while that she'd throw me over, but she didn't, because                 179
1505543she was in love with me too.  She thought I                               180
1505659knew a lot because I knew different things from her. . . .                180
1505749well, there I was, 'way off my ambitions, getting                         180
1505850deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I                        180
1505952didn't care.  What was the use of doing great things                      180
1506052if I could have a better time telling her what I was                      180
1506114going to do?"                                                             180
1506247On the last afternoon before he went abroad, he                           180
1506355sat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time.  It                   180
1506450was a cold fall day, with fire in the room and her                        180
1506546cheeks flushed.  Now and then she moved and he                            180
1506653changed his arm a little, and once he kissed her dark                     180
1506751shining hair.  The afternoon had made them tranquil                       180
1506849for a while, as if to give them a deep memory for                         180
1506949the long parting the next day promised.  They had                         180
1507058never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated                180
1507138more profoundly one with another, than                                    180
1507256when she brushed silent lips against his coat's shoulder                  180
1507350or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently,                        180
1507427as though she were asleep.                                                180
1507549He did extraordinarily well in the war.  He was a                         180
1507654captain before he went to the front, and following the                    180
1507751Argonne battles he got his majority and the command                       180
1507852of the divisional machine-guns.  After the Armistice                      180
1507942he tried frantically to get home, but some                                180
1508051complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford                       180
1508141instead.  He was worried now--there was a                                 180
1508251quality of nervous despair in Daisy's letters.  She                       180
1508349didn't see why he couldn't come.  She was feeling                         181
1508449the pressure of the world outside, and she wanted                         181
1508550to see him and feel his presence beside her and be                        181
1508656reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.                   181
1508748For Daisy was young and her artificial world was                          181
1508851redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery                       181
1508948and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year,                          181
1509049summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life                         181
1509150in new tunes.  All night the saxophones wailed the                        181
1509250hopeless comment of the "Beale Street Blues" while                        181
1509354a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled                    181
1509450the shining dust.  At the gray tea hour there were                        181
1509548always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this                          181
1509652low, sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and                      181
1509752there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around                      181
1509811the floor.                                                                181
1509945Through this twilight universe Daisy began to                             181
1510044move again with the season; suddenly she was                              181
1510150again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a                        181
1510247dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the                           181
1510351beads and chiffon of an evening dress tangled among                       181
1510451dying orchids on the floor beside her bed.  And all                       181
1510557the time something within her was crying for a decision.                  181
1510648She wanted her life shaped now, immediately--and                          181
1510743the decision must be made by some force--of                               181
1510852love, of money, of unquestionable practicality--that                      181
1510919was close at hand.                                                        181
1511050That force took shape in the middle of spring with                        181
1511151the arrival of Tom Buchanan.  There was a wholesome                       181
1511244bulkiness about his person and his position,                              182
1511355and Daisy was flattered.  Doubtless there was a certain                   182
1511450struggle and a certain relief.  The letter reached                        182
1511537Gatsby while he was still at Oxford.                                      182
1511642It was dawn now on Long Island and we went                                182
1511750about opening the rest of the windows down-stairs,                        182
1511849filling the house with gray-turning, gold-turning                         182
1511953light.  The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the                     182
1512050dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue                        182
1512147leaves.  There was a slow, pleasant movement in                           182
1512256the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool, lovely day.                   182
1512350"I don't think she ever loved him."  Gatsby turned                        182
1512453around from a window and looked at me challengingly.                      182
1512543"You must remember, old sport, she was very                               182
1512652excited this afternoon.  He told her those things in                      182
1512750a way that frightened her--that made it look as if                        182
1512849I was some kind of cheap sharper.  And the result                         182
1512942was she hardly knew what she was saying."                                 182
1513022He sat down gloomily.                                                     182
1513146"Of course she might have loved him just for a                            182
1513250minute, when they were first married--and loved me                        182
1513329more even then, do you see?"                                              182
1513444Suddenly he came out with a curious remark.                               182
1513550"In any case,"  he said,  "it was just personal."                         182
1513646What could you make of that, except to suspect                            182
1513751some intensity in his conception of the affair that                       182
1513822couldn't be measured?                                                     182
1513943He came back from France when Tom and Daisy                               182
1514054were still on their wedding trip, and made a miserable                    183
1514153but irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of                     183
1514250his army pay.  He stayed there a week, walking the                        183
1514350streets where their footsteps had clicked together                        183
1514460through the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way              183
1514538places to which they had driven in her                                    183
1514651white car.  Just as Daisy's house had always seemed                       183
1514749to him more mysterious and gay than other houses,                         183
1514851so his idea of the city itself, even though she was                       183
1514953gone from it, was pervaded with a melancholy beauty.                      183
1515050He left feeling that if he had searched harder, he                        183
1515154might have found her--that he was leaving her behind.                     183
1515240The day-coach--he was penniless now--was                                  183
1515352hot.  He went out to the open vestibule and sat down                      183
1515453on a folding-chair, and the station slid away and the                     183
1515549backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by.  Then out                         183
1515652into the spring fields, where a yellow trolley raced                      183
1515750them for a minute with people in it who might once                        183
1515853have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual                     183
1515908street.                                                                   183
1516047The track curved and now it was going away from                           183
1516149the sun, which as it sank lower, seemed to spread                         183
1516251itself in benediction over the vanishing city where                       183
1516347she had drawn her breath.  He stretched out his                           183
1516452hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air,                      183
1516548to save a fragment of the spot that she had made                          183
1516653lovely for him.  But it was all going by too fast now                     183
1516749for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost                         183
1516853that part of it, the freshest and the best, forever.                      183
1516946It was nine o'clock when we finished breakfast                            184
1517048and went out on the porch.  The night had made a                          184
1517148sharp difference in the weather and there was an                          184
1517253autumn flavor in the air.  The gardener, the last one                     184
1517352of Gatsby's former servants, came to the foot of the                      184
1517407steps.                                                                    184
1517549"I'm going to drain the pool to-day, Mr. Gatsby.                          184
1517653Leaves'll start falling pretty soon, and then there's                     184
1517732always trouble with the pipes."                                           184
1517843"Don't do it to-day,"  Gatsby answered.  He                               184
1517951turned to me apologetically.  "You know, old sport,                       184
1518039I've never used that pool all summer?"                                    184
1518135I looked at my watch and stood up.                                        184
1518230"Twelve minutes to my train."                                             184
1518350I didn't want to go to the city.  I wasn't worth a                        184
1518451decent stroke of work, but it was more than that--i                       184
1518550didn't want to leave Gatsby.  I missed that train,                        184
1518650and then another, before I could get myself away.                         184
1518737"I'll call you up,"  I said finally.                                      184
1518817"Do, old sport."                                                          184
1518928"I'll call you about noon."                                               184
1519033We walked slowly down the steps.                                          184
1519147"I suppose Daisy'll call too."  He looked at me                           184
1519248anxiously, as if he hoped I'd corroborate this.                           184
1519316"I suppose so."                                                           184
1519417"Well, good-by."                                                          184
1519547We shook hands and I started away.  Just before                           184
1519646I reached the hedge I remembered something and                            184
1519715turned around.                                                            184
1519847"They're a rotten crowd,"  I shouted across the                           185
1519945lawn.  "You're worth the whole damn bunch put                             185
1520011together."                                                                185
1520151I've always been glad I said that.  It was the only                       185
1520249compliment I ever gave him, because I disapproved                         185
1520346of him from beginning to end.  First he nodded                            185
1520451politely, and then his face broke into that radiant                       185
1520552and understanding smile, as if we'd been in ecstatic                      185
1520653cahoots on that fact all the time.  His gorgeous pink                     185
1520753rag of a suit made a bright spot of color against the                     185
1520852white steps, and I thought of the night when I first                      185
1520949came to his ancestral home, three months before.                          185
1521050The lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces                        185
1521150of those who guessed at his corruption--and he had                        185
1521250stood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible                        185
1521333dream, as he waved them good-by.                                          185
1521450I thanked him for his hospitality.  We were always                        185
1521541thanking him for that--i and the others.                                  185
1521644"Good-by,"  I called.  "I enjoyed breakfast,                              185
1521709Gatsby."                                                                  185
1521858Up in the city, I tried for a while to list the quotations                185
1521940on an interminable amount of stock, then                                  185
1522051I fell asleep in my swivel-chair.  Just before noon                       185
1522146the phone woke me, and I started up with sweat                            185
1522250breaking out on my forehead.  It was Jordan Baker;                        185
1522359she often called me up at this hour because the uncertainty               185
1522435of her own movements between hotels                                       185
1522550and clubs and private houses made her hard to find                        185
1522650in any other way.  Usually her voice came over the                        186
1522752wire as something fresh and cool, as if a divot from                      186
1522852a green golf-links had come sailing in at the office                      186
1522950window, but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.                         186
1523046"I've left Daisy's house,"  she said.  "I'm at                            186
1523144Hempstead, and I'm going down to Southampton                              186
1523217this afternoon."                                                          186
1523352Probably it had been tactful to leave Daisy's house,                      186
1523448but the act annoyed me, and her next remark made                          186
1523510me rigid.                                                                 186
1523640"You weren't so nice to me last night."                                   186
1523735"How could it have mattered then?"                                        186
1523828Silence for a moment.  Then:                                              186
1523930"However--i want to see you."                                             186
1524026"I want to see you, too."                                                 186
1524144"Suppose I don't go to Southampton, and come                              186
1524227into town this afternoon?"                                                186
1524336"No--i don't think this afternoon."                                       186
1524413"Very well."                                                              186
1524546"It's impossible this afternoon.  Various----"                            186
1524650We talked like that for a while, and then abruptly                        186
1524750we weren't talking any longer.  I don't know which                        186
1524853of us hung up with a sharp click, but I know I didn't                     186
1524955care.  I couldn't have talked to her across a tea-table                   186
1525047that day if I never talked to her again in this                           186
1525107world.                                                                    186
1525248I called Gatsby's house a few minutes later, but                          186
1525362the line was busy.  I tried four times; finally an exasperated            186
1525439central told me the wire was being kept                                   186
1525548open for long distance from Detroit.  Taking out                          187
1525647my time-table, I drew a small circle around the                           187
1525750three-fifty train.  Then I leaned back in my chair                        187
1525839and tried to think.  It was just noon.                                    187
1525944When I passed the ashheaps on the train that                              187
1526052morning I had crossed deliberately to the other side                      187
1526149of the car.  I suppose there'd be a curious crowd                         187
1526251around there all day with little boys searching for                       187
1526354dark spots in the dust, and some garrulous man telling                    187
1526448over and over what had happened, until it became                          187
1526543less and less real even to him and he could                               187
1526657tell it no longer, and Myrtle Wilson's tragic achievement                 187
1526739was forgotten.  Now I want to go back a                                   187
1526849little and tell what happened at the garage after                         187
1526932we left there the night before.                                           187
1527055They had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine.                    187
1527151She must have broken her rule against drinking that                       187
1527247night, for when she arrived she was stupid with                           187
1527350liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance                        187
1527450had already gone to Flushing.  When they convinced                        187
1527552her of this, she immediately fainted, as if that was                      187
1527654the intolerable part of the affair.  Some one, kind or                    187
1527749curious, took her in his car and drove her in the                         187
1527827wake of her sister's body.                                                187
1527949Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped                         187
1528055up against the front of the garage, while George Wilson                   187
1528151rocked himself back and forth on the couch inside.                        187
1528248For a while the door of the office was open, and                          187
1528355every one who came into the garage glanced irresistibly                   188
1528442through it.  Finally someone said it was a                                188
1528550shame, and closed the door.  Michaelis and several                        188
1528649other men were with him; first, four or five men,                         188
1528753later two or three men.  Still later Michaelis had to                     188
1528851ask the last stranger to wait there fifteen minutes                       188
1528947longer, while he went back to his own place and                           188
1529050made a pot of coffee.  After that, he stayed there                        188
1529130alone with Wilson until dawn.                                             188
1529254About three o'clock the quality of Wilson's incoherent                    188
1529338muttering changed--he grew quieter and                                    188
1529449began to talk about the yellow car.  He announced                         188
1529552that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car                      188
1529653belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of                     188
1529751months ago his wife had come from the city with her                       188
1529835face bruised and her nose swollen.                                        188
1529947But when he heard himself say this, he flinched                           188
1530052and began to cry "Oh, my God]" again in his groaning                      188
1530157voice.  Michaelis made a clumsy attempt to distract him.                  188
1530241"How long have you been married, George?                                  188
1530352Come on there, try and sit still a minute and answer                      188
1530447my question.  How long have you been married?"                            188
1530516"Twelve years."                                                           188
1530645"Ever had any children?  Come on, George, sit                             188
1530749still--i asked you a question.  Did you ever have                         188
1530815any children?"                                                            188
1530948The hard brown beetles kept thudding against the                          188
1531049dull light, and whenever Michaelis heard a car go                         188
1531153tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like                     189
1531251the car that hadn't stopped a few hours before.  He                       189
1531351didn't like to go into the garage, because the work                       189
1531448bench was stained where the body had been lying,                          189
1531547so he moved uncomfortably around the office--he                           189
1531648knew every object in it before morning--and from                          189
1531750time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep                        189
1531816him more quiet.                                                           189
1531943"Have you got a church you go to sometimes,                               189
1532049George?  Maybe even if you haven't been there for                         189
1532150a long time?  Maybe I could call up the church and                        189
1532251get a priest to come over and he could talk to you,                       189
1532306see?"                                                                     189
1532423"Don't belong to any."                                                    189
1532546"You ought to have a church, George, for times                            189
1532647like this.  You must have gone to church once.                            189
1532752Didn't you get married in a church?  Listen, George,                      189
1532852listen to me.  Didn't you get married in a church?"                       189
1532928"That was a long time ago."                                               189
1533047The effort of answering broke the rhythm of his                           189
1533146rocking--for a moment he was silent.  Then the                            189
1533249same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came back                         189
1533321into his faded eyes.                                                      189
1533449"Look in the drawer there,"  he said, pointing at                         189
1533510the desk.                                                                 189
1533616"Which drawer?"                                                           189
1533725"That drawer--that one."                                                  189
1533846Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand.                             189
1533957There was nothing in it but a small, expensive dog-leash,                 189
1534043made of leather and braided silver.  It was                               190
1534116apparently new.                                                           190
1534237"This?"  he inquired, holding it up.                                      190
1534326Wilson stared and nodded.                                                 190
1534451"I found it yesterday afternoon.  She tried to tell                       190
1534549me about it, but I knew it was something funny."                          190
1534632"You mean your wife bought it?"                                           190
1534742"She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her                                190
1534809bureau."                                                                  190
1534949Michaelis didn't see anything odd in that, and he                         190
1535046gave Wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might                            190
1535150have bought the dog-leash.  But conceivably Wilson                        190
1535249had heard some of these same explanations before,                         190
1535344from Myrtle, because he began saying "Oh, my                              190
1535452God]" again in a whisper--his comforter left several                      190
1535525explanations in the air.                                                  190
1535646"Then he killed her,"  said Wilson.  His mouth                            190
1535723dropped open suddenly.                                                    190
1535811"Who did?"                                                                190
1535931"I have a way of finding out."                                            190
1536049"You're morbid, George,"  said his friend.  "This                         190
1536148has been a strain to you and you don't know what                          190
1536251you're saying.  You'd better try and sit quiet till                       190
1536310morning."                                                                 190
1536419"He murdered her."                                                        190
1536530"It was an accident, George."                                             190
1536645Wilson shook his head.  His eyes narrowed and                             190
1536762his mouth widened slightly with the ghost of a superior "Hm]"             190
1536849"I know,"  he said definitely,  "I'm one of these                         191
1536953trusting fellas and I don't think any harm to nobody,                     191
1537049but when I get to know a thing I know it.  It was                         191
1537149the man in that car.  She ran out to speak to him                         191
1537223and he wouldn't stop."                                                    191
1537351Michaelis had seen this too, but it hadn't occurred                       191
1537454to him that there was any special significance in it.                     191
1537545He believed that Mrs. Wilson had been running                             191
1537649away from her husband, rather than trying to stop                         191
1537720any particular car.                                                       191
1537835"How could she of been like that?"                                        191
1537953"She's a deep one,"  said Wilson, as if that answered                     191
1538027the question.  "Ah-h-h----"                                               191
1538143He began to rock again, and Michaelis stood                               191
1538232twisting the leash in his hand.                                           191
1538349"Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone                         191
1538414for, George?"                                                             191
1538548This was a forlorn hope--he was almost sure that                          191
1538650Wilson had no friend:  there was not enough of him                        191
1538757for his wife.  He was glad a little later when he noticed                 191
1538842a change in the room, a blue quickening by                                191
1538951the window, and realized that dawn wasn't far off.                        191
1539048About five o'clock it was blue enough outside to                          191
1539120snap off the light.                                                       191
1539248Wilson's glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps,                          191
1539347where small gray clouds took on fantastic shape                           191
1539452and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind.                       191
1539554"I spoke to her,"  he muttered, after a long silence.                     191
1539651"I told her she might fool me but she couldn't fool                       191
1539750God.  I took her to the window"--with an effort he                        192
1539847got up and walked to the rear window and leaned                           192
1539950with his face pressed against it--"and I said 'God                        192
1540047knows what you've been doing, everything you've                           192
1540148been doing.  You may fool me, but you can't fool                          192
1540207God]'"                                                                    192
1540341Standing behind him, Michaelis saw with a                                 192
1540451shock that he was looking at the eyes of Doctor T.                        192
1540546J. Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and                            192
1540637enormous, from the dissolving night.                                      192
1540741"God sees everything,"  repeated Wilson.                                  192
1540851"That's an advertisement,"  Michaelis assured him.                        192
1540944Something made him turn away from the window                              192
1541046and look back into the room.  But Wilson stood                            192
1541153there a long time, his face close to the window pane,                     192
1541227nodding into the twilight.                                                192
1541351By six o'clock Michaelis was worn out, and grateful                       192
1541448for the sound of a car stopping outside.  It was                          192
1541547one of the watchers of the night before who had                           192
1541649promised to come back, so he cooked breakfast for                         192
1541748three, which he and the other man ate together.                           192
1541847Wilson was quieter now, and Michaelis went home                           192
1541953to sleep;  when he awoke four hours later and hurried                     192
1542037back to the garage, Wilson was gone.                                      192
1542148His movements--he was on foot all the time--were                          192
1542243afterward traced to Port Roosevelt and then                               192
1542349to Gad's Hill, where he bought a sandwich that he                         192
1542451didn't eat, and a cup of coffee.  He must have been                       192
1542551tired and walking slowly, for he didn't reach Gad's                       193
1542653Hill until noon.  Thus far there was no difficulty in                     193
1542748accounting for his time--there were boys who had                          193
1542851seen a man "acting sort of crazy," and motorists at                       193
1542948whom he stared oddly from the side of the road.                           193
1543047Then for three hours he disappeared from view.                            193
1543146The police, on the strength of what he said to                            193
1543246Michaelis, that he "had a way of finding out,"                            193
1543350supposed that he spent that time going from garage                        193
1543444to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow                              193
1543546car.  On the other hand, no garage man who had                            193
1543646seen him ever came forward, and perhaps he had                            193
1543750an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted                        193
1543846to know.  By half-past two he was in West Egg,                            193
1543950where he asked someone the way to Gatsby's house.                         193
1544039So by that time he knew Gatsby's name.                                    193
1544145At two o'clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit                             193
1544252and left word with the butler that if any one phoned                      193
1544346word was to be brought to him at the pool.  He                            193
1544451stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that                       193
1544548had amused his guests during the summer, and the                          193
1544659chauffeur helped him pump it up.  Then he gave instructions               193
1544740that the open car wasn't to be taken out                                  193
1544854under any circumstances--and this was strange, because                    193
1544938the front right fender needed repair.                                     193
1545046Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for                            193
1545151the pool.  Once he stopped and shifted it a little,                       193
1545250and the chauffeur asked him if he needed help, but                        193
1545345he shook his head and in a moment disappeared                             194
1545427among the yellowing trees.                                                194
1545544No telephone message arrived, but the bulter                              194
1545651went without his sleep and waited for it until four                       194
1545751o'clock--until long after there was any one to give                       194
1545853it to if it came.  I have an idea that Gatsby himself                     194
1545947didn't believe it would come, and perhaps he no                           194
1546054longer cared.  If that was true he must have felt that                    194
1546149he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price                         194
1546249for living too long with a single dream.  He must                         194
1546355have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening                   194
1546448leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque                          194
1546544thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was                              194
1546655upon the scarcely created grass.  A new world, material                   194
1546748without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing                          194
1546850dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about . . .                         194
1546952like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him                      194
1547029through the amorphous trees.                                              194
1547156The chauffeur--he was one of Wolfshiem's proteges--heard                  194
1547238the shots--afterward he could only say                                    194
1547349that he hadn't thought anything much about them.                          194
1547451I drove from the station directly to Gatsby's house                       194
1547547and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was                           194
1547652the first thing that alarmed any one.  But they knew                      194
1547751then, I firmly believe.  With scarcely a word said,                       194
1547851four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I,                       194
1547926hurried down to the pool.                                                 194
1548046There was a faint, barely perceptible movement                            194
1548149of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged                         194
1548250its way toward the drain at the other. with little                        195
1548350ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the                        195
1548448laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool.                           195
1548549A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the                         195
1548651surface was enough to disturb its accidental course                       195
1548751with its accidental burden.  The touch of a cluster                       195
1548854of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of                    195
1548941compass, a thin red circle in the water.                                  195
1549046It was after we started with Gatsby toward the                            195
1549150house that the gardener saw Wilson's body a little                        195
1549254way off in the grass, and the holocaust was complete.                     195
1549310CHAPTER IX                                                                196
1549448AFTER two years I remember the rest of that day,                          196
1549551and that night and the next day, only as an endless                       196
1549647drill of police and photographers and newspaper                           196
1549746men in and out of Gatsby's front door.  A rope                            196
1549849stretched across the main gate and a policeman by                         196
1549956it kept out the curious, but little boys soon discovered                  196
1550042that they could enter through my yard, and                                196
1550154there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed                    196
1550240about the pool.  Someone with a positive                                  196
1550348manner, perhaps a detective, used the expression                          196
1550443"madman" as he bent over Wilson's body that                               196
1550548afternoon, and the adventitious authority of his                          196
1550648voice set the key for the newspaper reports next                          196
1550709morning.                                                                  196
1550850Most of those reports were a nightmare--grotesque,                        196
1550940circumstantial, eager, and untrue.  When                                  196
1551053Michaelis's testimony at the inquest brought to light                     196
1551151Wilson's suspicions of his wife I thought the whole                       196
1551255tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade--but                   196
1551340Catherine, who might have said anything,                                  196
1551450didn't say a word.  She showed a surprising amount                        196
1551553of character about it too--looked at the coroner with                     196
1551650determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers,                        196
1551748and swore that her sister had never seen Gatsby,                          196
1551854that her sister was completely happy with her husband,                    196
1551941that her sister had been into no mischief                                 197
1552054whatever.  She convinced herself of it, and cried into                    197
1552152her handkerchief, as if the very suggestion was more                      197
1552250than she could endure.  So Wilson was reduced to a                        197
1552346man "deranged by grief" in order that the case                            197
1552449might remain in its simplist form.  And it rested                         197
1552507there.                                                                    197
1552655But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential.                    197
1552744I found myself on Gatsby's side, and alone.                               197
1552852From the moment I telephoned news of the catastrophe                      197
1552940to West Egg village, every surmise about                                  197
1553050him, and every practical question, was referred to                        197
1553152me.  At first I was surprised and confused; then, as                      197
1553249he lay in his house and didn't move or breathe or                         197
1553349speak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was                         197
1553460responsible, because no one else was interested--interested,              197
1553543I mean, with that intense personal interest                               197
1553642to which every one has some vague right at                                197
1553709the end.                                                                  197
1553850I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him,                        197
1553953called her instinctively and without hesitation.  But                     197
1554047she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon,                           197
1554129and taken baggage with them.                                              197
1554219"Left no address?"                                                        197
1554306"No."                                                                     197
1554427"Say when they'd be back?"                                                197
1554506"No."                                                                     197
1554644"Any idea where they are?  How I could reach                              197
1554707them?"                                                                    197
1554828"I don't know.  Can't say."                                               198
1554946I wanted to get somebody for him.  I wanted to                            198
1555047go into the room where he lay and reassure him:                           198
1555150"I'll get somebody for you, Gatsby.  Don't worry.                         198
1555248Just trust me and I'll get somebody for you----"                          198
1555342Meyer Wolfshiem's name wasn't in the phone                                198
1555447book.  The butler gave me his office address on                           198
1555546Broadway, and I called Information, but by the                            198
1555649time I had the number it was long after five, and                         198
1555727no one answered the phone.                                                198
1555823"Will you ring again?"                                                    198
1555930"I've rung them three times."                                             198
1556023"It's very important."                                                    198
1556137"Sorry.  I'm afraid no one's there."                                      198
1556247I went back to the drawing-room and thought for                           198
1556352an instant that they were chance visitors, all these                      198
1556448official people who suddenly filled it.  But, as                          198
1556550they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with                        198
1556648unmoved eyes, his protest continued in my brain:                          198
1556749"Look here, old sport, you've got to get somebody                         198
1556844for me.  You've got to try hard.  I can't go                              198
1556921through this alone."                                                      198
1557049Some one started to ask me questions, but I broke                         198
1557147away and going up-stairs looked hastily through                           198
1557250the unlocked parts of his desk--he'd never told me                        198
1557349definitely that his parents were dead.  But there                         198
1557450was nothing--only the picture of Dan Cody, a token                        198
1557551of forgotten violence, staring down from the wall.                        198
1557647Next morning I sent the butler to New York with                           198
1557750a letter to Wolfshiem, which asked for information                        199
1557850and urged him to come out on the next train.  That                        199
1557950request seemed superfluous when I wrote it.  I was                        199
1558048sure he'd start when he saw the newspapers, just                          199
1558149as I was sure there'd be a wire from Daisy before                         199
1558251noon--but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem arrived;                       199
1558351no one arrived except more police and photographers                       199
1558448and newspaper men.  When the butler brought back                          199
1558557Wolfshiem's answer I began to have a feeling of defiance,                 199
1558641of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and                                 199
1558721me against them all.                                                      199
1558849Dear Mr. Carraway.  This has been one of the most                         199
1558961terrible shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that             199
1559057it is true at all.  Such a mad act as that man did should                 199
1559158make us all think.  I cannot come down now as I am tied up                199
1559258in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in                199
1559361this thing now.  If there is anything I can do a little later             199
1559456let me know in a letter by Edgar.  I hardly know where I                  199
1559556am when I hear about a thing like this and am completely                  199
1559622knocked down and out.                                                     199
1559711Yours truly                                                               199
1559815MEYER WOLFSHIEM                                                           199
1559931and then hasty addenda beneath:                                           199
1560049Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his                         199
1560115family at all.                                                            199
1560243When the phone rang that afternoon and Long                               199
1560348Distance said Chicago was calling I thought this                          199
1560448would be Daisy at last.  But the connection came                          200
1560550through as a man's voice, very thin and far away.                         200
1560629"This is Slagle speaking..."                                              200
1560733"Yes?"  The name was unfamiliar.                                          200
1560842"Hell of a note, isn't it?  Get my wire?"                                 200
1560932"There haven't been any wires."                                           200
1561046"Young Parke's in trouble,"  he said rapidly.                             200
1561149"They picked him up when he handed the bonds over                         200
1561247the counter.  They got a circular from New York                           200
1561349giving 'em the numbers just five minutes before.                          200
1561447What d'you know about that, hey?  You never can                           200
1561529tell in these hick towns----"                                             200
1561655"Hello]"  I interrupted breathlessly.  "Look here--this                   200
1561739isn't Mr. Gatsby.  Mr. Gatsby's dead."                                    200
1561848There was a long silence on the other end of the                          200
1561951wire, followed by an exclamation . . . then a quick                       200
1562037squawk as the connection was broken.                                      200
1562147I think it was on the third day that a telegram                           200
1562255signed Henry C. Gatz arrived from a town in Minnesota.                    200
1562352It said only that the sender was leaving immediately                      200
1562443and to postpone the funeral until he came.                                200
1562546It was Gatsby's father, a solemn old man, very                            200
1562649helpless and dismayed, bundled up in a long cheap                         200
1562748ulster against the warm September day.  His eyes                          200
1562847leaked continuously with excitement, and when I                           200
1562949took the bag and umbrella from his hands he began                         200
1563052to pull so incessantly at his sparse gray beard that                      200
1563152I had difficulty in getting off his coat.  He was on                      200
1563251the point of collapse, so I took him into the music                       201
1563353room and made him sit down while I sent for something                     201
1563446to eat.  But he wouldn't eat, and the glass of                            201
1563538milk spilled from his trembling hand.                                     201
1563647"I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,"  he said.                            201
1563748"It was all in the Chicago newspaper.  I started                          201
1563813right away."                                                              201
1563934"I didn't know how to reach you."                                         201
1564049His eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about                         201
1564110the room.                                                                 201
1564243"It was a madman,"  he said.  "He must have                               201
1564311been mad."                                                                201
1564447"Wouldn't you like some coffee?"  I urged him.                            201
1564543"I don't want anything.  I'm all right now,                               201
1564608Mr.----"                                                                  201
1564712"Carraway."                                                               201
1564846"Well, I'm all right now.  Where have they got                            201
1564908Jimmy?"                                                                   201
1565047I took him into the drawing-room, where his son                           201
1565151lay, and left him there.  Some little boys had come                       201
1565253up on the steps and were looking into the hall;  when                     201
1565350I told them who had arrived, they went reluctantly                        201
1565406away.                                                                     201
1565549After a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and                         201
1565652came out, his mouth ajar, his face flushed slightly,                      201
1565751his eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual tears.  He                       201
1565848had reached an age where death no longer has the                          201
1565947quality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked                           201
1566045around him now for the first time and saw the                             201
1566151height and splendor of the hall and the great rooms                       202
1566253opening out from it into other rooms, his grief began                     202
1566348to be mixed with an awed pride.  I helped him to                          202
1566452a bedroom up-stairs;  while he took off his coat and                      202
1566555vest I told him that all arrangements had been deferred                   202
1566615until he came.                                                            202
1566747"I didn't know what you'd want, Mr. Gatsby----"                           202
1566819"Gatz is my name."                                                        202
1566946"--Mr. Gatz.  I thought you might want to take                            202
1567016the body West."                                                           202
1567119He shook his head.                                                        202
1567244"Jimmy always liked it better down East.  He                              202
1567348rose up to his position in the East.  Were you a                          202
1567430friend of my boy's, Mr.----?"                                             202
1567525"We were close friends."                                                  202
1567646"He had a big future before him, you know.  He                            202
1567747was only a young man, but he had a lot of brain                           202
1567813power here."                                                              202
1567948He touched his head impressively, and I nodded.                           202
1568047"If he'd of lived, he'd of been a great man.  A                           202
1568152man like James J. Hill.  He'd of helped build up the                      202
1568210country."                                                                 202
1568339"That's true,"  I said, uncomfortably.                                    202
1568446He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying                            202
1568569to take it from the bed, and lay down stiffly--was instantly asleep.      202
1568648That night an obviously frightened person called                          202
1568744up, and demanded to know who I was before he                              202
1568821would give his name.                                                      202
1568933"This is Mr. Carraway,"  I said.                                          203
1569053"Oh]"  He sounded relieved.  "This is Klipspringer."                      203
1569154I was relieved too, for that seemed to promise another                    203
1569246friend at Gatsby's grave.  I didn't want it to                            203
1569349be in the papers and draw a sightseeing crowd, so                         203
1569451I'd been calling up a few people myself.  They were                       203
1569514hard to find.                                                             203
1569652"The funeral's to-morrow,"  I said.  "Three o'clock,                      203
1569751here at the house.  I wish you'd tell anybody who'd                       203
1569816be interested."                                                           203
1569948"Oh, I will,"  he broke out hastily.  "Of course                          203
1570045I'm not likely to see anybody, but if I do."                              203
1570129His tone made me suspicious.                                              203
1570238"Of course you'll be there yourself."                                     203
1570350"Well, I'll certainly try.  What I called up about                        203
1570407is----"                                                                   203
1570544"Wait a minute,"  I interrupted.  "How about                              203
1570621saying you'll come?"                                                      203
1570751"Well, the fact is--the truth of the matter is that                       203
1570850I'm staying with some people up here in Greenwich,                        203
1570953and they rather expect me to be with them to-morrow.                      203
1571048In fact, there's a sort of picnic or something.                           203
1571137Of course I'll do my very best to get                                     203
1571207away."                                                                    203
1571342I ejaculated an unrestrained "Huh]" and he                                203
1571445must have heard me, for he went on nervously:                             203
1571550"What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left                        203
1571652there.  I wonder if it'd be too much trouble to have                      203
1571749the bulter send them on.  You see, they're tennis                         204
1571849shoes, and I'm sort of helpless without them.  My                         204
1571929address is care of B. F.----"                                             204
1572050I didn't hear the rest of the name, because I hung                        204
1572117up the receiver.                                                          204
1572249After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby--one                         204
1572350gentleman to whom I telephoned implied that he had                        204
1572450got what he deserved.  However, that was my fault,                        204
1572555for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly                   204
1572644at Gatsby on the courage of Gatsby's liquor,                              204
1572749and I should have known better than to call him.                          204
1572843The morning of the funeral I went up to New                               204
1572948York to see Meyer Wolfshiem;  I couldn't seem to                          204
1573048reach him any other way.  The door that I pushed                          204
1573150open, on the advice of an elevator boy, was marked                        204
1573250"The Swastika Holding Company," and at first there                        204
1573347didn't seem to be any one inside.  But when I'd                           204
1573450shouted "hello" several times in vain, an argument                        204
1573552broke out behind a partition, and presently a lovely                      204
1573651Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized                       204
1573728me with black hostile eyes.                                               204
1573848"Nobody's in,"  she said.  "Mr. Wolfshiem's gone                          204
1573913to Chicago."                                                              204
1574048The first part of this was obviously untrue, for                          204
1574163someone had begun to whistle "The Rosary," tunelessly, inside.            204
1574249"Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him."                          204
1574344"I can't get him back from Chicago, can I?"                               204
1574449At this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem's,                         204
1574543called "Stella]" from the other side of the                               205
1574606door.                                                                     205
1574750"Leave your name on the desk,"  she said quickly.                         205
1574841"I'll give it to him when he gets back."                                  205
1574925"But I know he's there."                                                  205
1575048She took a step toward me and began to slide her                          205
1575140hands indignantly up and down her hips.                                   205
1575243"You young men think you can force your way                               205
1575360in here any time,"  she scolded.  "We're getting sickantired              205
1575443of it.  When I say he's in Chicago, he's in                               205
1575510Chicago."                                                                 205
1575620I mentioned Gatsby.                                                       205
1575748"Oh-h]"  She looked at me over again.  "Will you                          205
1575830just---- What was your name?"                                             205
1575942She vanished.  In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem                                205
1576047stood solemnly in the doorway, holding out both                           205
1576150hands.  He drew me into his office, remarking in a                        205
1576252reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us,                      205
1576324and offered me a cigar.                                                   205
1576446"My memory goes back to when I first met him,"                            205
1576549he said.  "A young major just out of the army and                         205
1576651covered over with medals he got in the war.  He was                       205
1576748so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform                          205
1576852because he couldn't buy some regular clothes.  First                      205
1576950time I saw him was when he come into Winebrenner's                        205
1577044poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for                              205
1577153a job.  He hadn't eat anything for a couple of days.                      205
1577249'come on have some lunch with me,' I sid.  He ate                         205
1577356more than four dollars' worth of food in half an hour."                   205
1577446"Did you start him in business?"  I inquired.                             206
1577526"Start him]  I made him."                                                 206
1577606"Oh."                                                                     206
1577749"I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the                         206
1577850gutter.  I saw right away he was a fine-appearing,                        206
1577945gentlemanly young man, and when he told me he                             206
1578047was an Oggsford I knew I could use him good.  I                           206
1578148got him to join up in the American Legion and he                          206
1578248used to stand high there.  Right off he did some                          206
1578348work for a client of mine up to Albany.  We were                          206
1578449so thick like that in everything"--he held up two                         206
1578536bulbous fingers--"always together."                                       206
1578647I wondered if this partnership had included the                           206
1578736World's Series transaction in 1919.                                       206
1578846"Now he's dead,"  I said after a moment.  "You                            206
1578949were his closest friend, so I know you'll want to                         206
1579037come to his funeral this afternoon."                                      206
1579120"I'd like to come."                                                       206
1579219"Well, come then."                                                        206
1579350The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as                        206
1579446he shook his head his eyes filled with tears.                             206
1579548"I can't do it--i can't get mixed up in it,"  he                          206
1579606said.                                                                     206
1579751"There's nothing to get mixed up in.  It's all over                       206
1579806now."                                                                     206
1579949"When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed                         206
1580047up in it in any way.  I keep out.  When I was a                           206
1580153young man it was different--if a friend of mine died,                     206
1580249no matter how, I stuck with them to the end.  You                         206
1580351may think that's sentimental, but I mean it--to the                       207
1580413bitter end."                                                              207
1580555I saw that for some reason of his own he was determined                   207
1580628not to come, so I stood up.                                               207
1580748"Are you a college man?"  he inquired suddenly.                           207
1580846For a moment I thought he was going to suggest                            207
1580948a "gonnegtion,"  but he only nodded and shook my                          207
1581006hand.                                                                     207
1581146"Let us learn to show our friendship for a man                            207
1581259when he is alive and not after he is dead,"  he suggested.                207
1581344"After that my own rule is to let everything                              207
1581408alone."                                                                   207
1581550When I left his office the sky had turned dark and                        207
1581652I got back to West Egg in a drizzle.  After changing                      207
1581746my clothes I went next door and found Mr. Gatz                            207
1581847walking up and down excitedly in the hall.  His                           207
1581961pride in his son and in his son's possessions was continually             207
1582038increasing and now he had something to                                    207
1582109show me.                                                                  207
1582246"Jimmy sent me this picture."  He took out his                            207
1582346wallet with trembling fingers.  "Look there."                             207
1582448It was a photograph of the house, cracked in the                          207
1582550corners and dirty with many hands.  He pointed out                        207
1582651every detail to me eagerly.  "Look there]" and then                       207
1582748sought admiration from my eyes.  He had shown it                          207
1582849so often that I think it was more real to him now                         207
1582923than the house itself.                                                    207
1583049"Jimmy sent it to me.  I think it's a very pretty                         207
1583129picture.  It shows up well."                                              207
1583239"Very well.  Had you seen him lately?"                                    208
1583347"He come out to see me two years ago and bought                           208
1583451me the house I live in now.  Of course we was broke                       208
1583549up when he run off from home, but I see now there                         208
1583652was a reason for it.  He knew he had a big future in                      208
1583750front of him.  And ever since he made a success he                        208
1583828was very generous with me."                                               208
1583949He seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held                         208
1584052it for another minute, lingeringly, before my eyes.                       208
1584147Then he returned the wallet and pulled from his                           208
1584262pocket a ragged old copy of a book called "Hopalong Cassidy."             208
1584347"Look here, this is a book he had when he was a                           208
1584426boy.  It just shows you."                                                 208
1584544He opened it at the back cover and turned it                              208
1584655around for me to see.  On the last fly-leaf was printed                   208
1584745the word SCHEDULE, and the date September 12,                             208

1586352"I come across this book by accident,"  said the old                      209
1586437man.  "It just shows you, don't it?"                                      209
1586521"It just shows you."                                                      209
1586645"Jimmy was bound to get ahead.  He always had                             209
1586752some resolves like this or something.  Do you notice                      209
1586847what he's got about improving his mind?  He was                           209
1586950always great for that.  He told me I et like a hog                        209
1587030once, and I beat him for it."                                             209
1587148He was reluctant to close the book, reading each                          209
1587251item aloud and then looking eagerly at me.  I think                       209
1587350he rather expected me to copy down the list for my                        209
1587409own use.                                                                  209
1587551A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived                       209
1587648from Flushing, and I began to look involuntarily                          209
1587748out the windows for other cars.  So did Gatsby's                          209
1587848father.  And as the time passed and the servants                          209
1587947came in and stood waiting in the hall, his eyes                           209
1588050began to blink anxiously, and he spoke of the rain                        209
1588150in a worried, uncertain way.  The minister glanced                        209
1588251several times at his watch, so I took him aside and                       209
1588350asked him to wait for half an hour.  But it wasn't                        209
1588423any use.  Nobody came.                                                    209
1588547About five o'clock our procession of three cars                           209
1588651reached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle                       209
1588753beside the gate--first a motor hearse, horribly black                     210
1588848and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in                          210
1588955the limousine, and a little later four or five servants                   210
1589049and the postman from West Egg in Gatsby's station                         210
1589154wagon, all wet to the skin.  As we started through the                    210
1589254gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then the                    210
1589350sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy                        210
1589455ground.  I looked around.  It was the man with owl-eyed                   210
1589549glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gatsby's                         210
1589643books in the library one night three months                               210
1589708before.                                                                   210
1589848I'd never seen him since then.  I don't know how                          210
1589949he knew about the funeral, or even his name.  The                         210
1590047rain poured down his thick glasses, and he took                           210
1590152them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas                      210
1590230unrolled from Gatsby's grave.                                             210
1590348I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment,                          210
1590449but he was already too far away, and I could only                         210
1590547remember, without resentment, that Daisy hadn't                           210
1590650sent a message or a flower.  Dimly I heard someone                        210
1590749murmur, "Blessed are the dead that the rain falls                         210
1590845on," and then the owl-eyed man said  "Amen to                             210
1590926that,"  in a brave voice.                                                 210
1591045We straggled down quickly through the rain to                             210
1591145the cars.  Owl-eyes spoke to me by the gate.                              210
1591245"I couldn't get to the house,"  he remarked.                              210
1591330"Neither could anybody else."                                             210
1591446"Go on]"  He started.  "Why, my God] they used                            210
1591530to go there by the hundreds."                                             210
1591645He took off his glasses and wiped them again,                             211
1591716outside and in.                                                           211
1591836"The poor son-of-a-bitch," he said.                                       211
1591947One of my most vivid memories is of coming back                           211
1592047West from prep school and later from college at                           211
1592144Christmas time.  Those who went farther than                              211
1592241Chicago would gather in the old dim Union                                 211
1592352Station at six o'clock of a December evening, with a                      211
1592449few Chicago friends, already caught up into their                         211
1592551own holiday gayeties, to bid them a hasty good-by.                        211
1592652I remember the fur coats of the girls returning from                      211
1592752Miss THIS-OR-that's and the chatter of frozen breath                      211
1592848and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight                          211
1592955of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations:                   211
1593047"Are you going to the Ordways'?  the Herseys'?                            211
1593143the Schultzes'?" and the long green tickets                               211
1593248clasped tight in our gloved hands.  And last the                          211
1593350murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St.                         211
1593453Paul railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on                     211
1593528the tracks beside the gate.                                               211
1593648When we pulled out into the winter night and the                          211
1593751real snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us                       211
1593844and twinkle against the windows, and the dim                              211
1593952lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp                      211
1594050wild brace came suddenly into the air.  We drew in                        211
1594148deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner                          211
1594249through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of                         211
1594352our identity with this country for one strange hour,                      212
1594450before we melted indistinguishably into it again.                         212
1594543That's my Middle West--not the wheat or the                               212
1594651prairies or the lost Swede towns, but the thrilling                       212
1594750returning trains of my youth, and the street lamps                        212
1594851and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows                       212
1594949of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the                         212
1595050snow.  I am part of that, a little solemn with the                        212
1595152feel of those long winters, a little complacent from                      212
1595248growing up in the Carraway house in a city where                          212
1595347dwellings are still called through decades by a                           212
1595452family's name.  I see now that this has been a story                      212
1595549of the West, after all--Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and                         212
1595649Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we                         212
1595746possessed some deficiency in common which made                            212
1595839us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.                                    212
1595945Even when the East excited me most, even when                             212
1596049I was most keenly aware of its superiority to the                         212
1596148bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio,                          212
1596249with their interminable inquisitions which spared                         212
1596348only the children and the very old--even then it                          212
1596448had always for me a quality of distortion.  West                          212
1596551Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic                       212
1596650dreams.  I see it as a night scene by El Greco:  a                        212
1596751hundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque,                       212
1596847crouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a                           212
1596947lustreless moon.  In the foreground four solemn                           212
1597049men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk                         212
1597149with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in                         212
1597247a white evening dress.  Her hand, which dangles                           213
1597350over the side, sparkles cold with jewels.  Gravely                        213
1597449the men turn in at a house--the wrong house.  But                         213
1597541no one knows the woman's name, and no one                                 213
1597607cares.                                                                    213
1597745After Gatsby's death the East was haunted for                             213
1597848me like that, distorted beyond my eyes' power of                          213
1597953correction.  So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves                     213
1598048was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry                          213
1598147stiff on the line I decided to come back home.                            213
1598248There was one thing to be done before I left, an                          213
1598349awkward, unpleasant thing that perhaps had better                         213
1598450have been let alone.  But I wanted to leave things                        213
1598557in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent                 213
1598642sea to sweep my refuse away.  I saw Jordan                                213
1598750Baker and talked over and around what had happened                        213
1598847to us together, and what had happened afterward                           213
1598949to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, in                         213
1599013a big chair.                                                              213
1599144She was dressed to play golf, and I remember                              213
1599254thinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin                    213
1599350raised a little jauntily, her hair the color of an                        213
1599448autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the                          213
1599550fingerless glove on her knee.  When I had finished                        213
1599648she told me without comment that she was engaged                          213
1599745to another man.  I doubted that, though there                             213
1599851were several she could have married at a nod of her                       213
1599957head, but I pretended to be surprised.  For just a minute                 213
1600040I wondered if I wasn't making a mistake,                                  213
1600151then I thought it all over again quickly and got up                       214
1600216to say good-by.                                                           214
1600350"Nevertheless you did throw me over,"  said Jordan                        214
1600448suddenly.  "You threw me over on the telephone.                           214
1600547I don't give a damn about you now, but it was a                           214
1600652new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for                      214
1600710a while."                                                                 214
1600816We shook hands.                                                           214
1600940"Oh, and do you remember"--she added--"a                                  214
1601047conversation we had once about driving a car?"                            214
1601120"Why--not exactly."                                                       214
1601246"You said a bad driver was only safe until she                            214
1601348met another bad driver?  Well, I met another bad                          214
1601450driver, didn't I?  I mean it was careless of me to                        214
1601551make such a wrong guess.  I thought you were rather                       214
1601652an honest, straightforward person.  I thought it was                      214
1601720your secret pride."                                                       214
1601854"I'm thirty,"  I said.  "I'm five years too old to lie                    214
1601930to myself and call it honor."                                             214
1602048She didn't answer.  Angry, and half in love with                          214
1602144her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away.                               214
1602250One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan.                         214
1602338He was walking ahead of me along Fifth                                    214
1602452Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a                      214
1602553little from his body as if to fight off interference,                     214
1602648his head moving sharply here and there, adapting                          214
1602752itself to his restless eyes.  Just as I slowed up to                      214
1602850avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning                        214
1602949into the windows of a jewelry store.  Suddenly he                         215
1603046saw me and walked back, holding out his hand.                             215
1603143"What's the matter, Nick?  Do you object to                               215
1603224shaking hands with me?"                                                   215
1603338"Yes.  You know what I think of you."                                     215
1603447"You're crazy, Nick,"  he said quickly.  "Crazy                           215
1603552as hell.  I don't know what's the matter with you."                       215
1603648"Tom,"  I inquired,  "what did you say to Wilson                          215
1603717that afternoon?"                                                          215
1603844He stared at me without a word, and I knew I                              215
1603947had guessed right about those missing hours.  I                           215
1604049started to turn away, but he took a step after me                         215
1604120and grabbed my arm.                                                       215
1604250"I told him the truth,"  he said.  "He came to the                        215
1604351door while we were getting ready to leave, and when                       215
1604447I sent down word that we weren't in he tried to                           215
1604548force his way up-stairs.  He was crazy enough to                          215
1604648kill me if I hadn't told him who owned the car.                           215
1604746His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every                            215
1604857minute he was in the house----"  He broke off defiantly.                  215
1604941"What if I did tell him?  That fellow had                                 215
1605047it coming to him.  He threw dust into your eyes                           215
1605153just like he did in Daisy's, but he was a tough one.                      215
1605248He ran over Myrtle like you'd run over a dog and                          215
1605329never even stopped his car."                                              215
1605457There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable                 215
1605526fact that it wasn't true.                                                 215
1605659"And if you think I didn't have my share of suffering--look               215
1605738here, when I went to give up that flat                                    215
1605851and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there                       216
1605952on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby.                       216
1606024By God it was awful----"                                                  216
1606150I couldn't forgive him or like him, but I saw that                        216
1606253what he had done was, to him, entirely justified.  It                     216
1606355was all very careless and confused.  They were careless                   216
1606438people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up                                    216
1606549things and creatures and then retreated back into                         216
1606651their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever                       216
1606752it was that kept them together, and let other people                      216
1606836clean up the mess they had made....                                       216
1606951I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for                       216
1607053I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child.                      216
1607144Then he went into the jewelry store to buy a                              216
1607259pearl necklace--or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons--rid               216
1607340of my provincial squeamishness forever.                                   216
1607447Gatsby's house was still empty when I left--the                           216
1607549grass on his lawn had grown as long as mine.  One                         216
1607652of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare                      216
1607752past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute                      216
1607848and pointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove                          216
1607950Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the                        216
1608047accident, and perhaps he had made a story about                           216
1608155it all his own.  I didn't want to hear it and I avoided                   216
1608230him when I got off the train.                                             216
1608346I spent my Saturday nights in New York because                            216
1608449those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with                         216
1608551me so vividly that I could still hear the music and                       216
1608651the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden,                       217
1608746and the cars going up and down his drive.  One                            217
1608850night I did hear a material car there, and saw its                        217
1608959lights stop at his front steps.  But I didn't investigate.                217
1609040Probably it was some final guest who had                                  217
1609150been away at the ends of the earth and didn't know                        217
1609225that the party was over.                                                  217
1609346On the last night, with my trunk packed and my                            217
1609449car sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at                         217
1609551that huge incoherent failure of a house once more.                        217
1609647On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by                           217
1609752some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in                      217
1609847the moonlight, and I erased it, drawing my shoe                           217
1609948raspingly along the stone.  Then I wandered down                          217
1610043to the beach and sprawled out on the sand.                                217
1610148Most of the big shore places were closed now and                          217
1610248there were hardly any lights except the shadowy,                          217
1610349moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound.  And                         217
1610452as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began                      217
1610546to melt away until gradually I became aware of                            217
1610648the old island here that flowered once for Dutch                          217
1610755sailors' eyes--a fresh, green breast of the new world.                    217
1610851Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for                       217
1610948Gatsby's house, had once pandered in whispers to                          217
1611048the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a                          217
1611146transitory enchanted moment man must have held                            217
1611255his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled                   217
1611353into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood                     217
1611443nor desired, face to face for the last time                               217
1611545in history with something commensurate to his                             218
1611621capacity for wonder.                                                      218
1611747And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown                           218
1611849world, I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first                         218
1611955picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock.                    218
1612049He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his                         218
1612145dream must have seemed so close that he could                             218
1612249hardly fail to grasp it.  He did not know that it                         218
1612346was already behind him, somewhere back in that                            218
1612446vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark                            218
1612550fields of the republic rolled on under the night.                         218
1612648Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic                          218
1612754future that year by year recedes before us.  It eluded                    218
1612848us then, but that's no matter--to-morrow we will                          218
1612951run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . and                       218
1613020one fine morning----                                                      218
1613147So we beat on, boats against the current, borne                           218
1613232back ceaselessly into the past.                                           218
